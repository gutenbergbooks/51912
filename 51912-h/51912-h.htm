      THE WORD OF PREFACE
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">I</span>t should be said
      in the beginning that these memoirs will not be written by my own hand. I
      have no skill of pen and ink, and any relation of length would be beyond
      my genius. The phrasing would fall to be disreputable, and the story
      itself turn involved and to step on its own toes, and mayhap with the last
      of it to fall flat on its face, unable to proceed at all. Wherefore, as
      much for folk who are to read as for my own credit, I shall have one who
      makes print his trade to write these pages for me.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nor shall I advance apology in this. If I plan for the construction of a
      house, I call to my aid architects and artisans in wood and stone and
      iron. I am not disgraced for that out of my own hands and head I do not
      throw up the walls and lay on the roof of the edifice. Why, then, when now
      I am about the paper-telling of my life, should I blush because I am
      driven to seek the aid of him who makes an inkpot his profession? I am
      like a lumber-yard or a stone-quarry, and full of the raw material for
      this work; but I require one drilled of saw and chisel to carry off the
      business of my housebuilding.
    </p>
    <p>
      It would be the thing natural, should you who open these leaves put the
      question of motive and ask why, when now I am retired, and should be
      cautious with my threescore years, I come forth with confidences which,
      aside from the mere sorrow of them, are like to prove less for my honor
      than I might wish. Why is it that I who have removed my loneliness and my
      millions to scenes of peace at least, may not leave well enough alone? Why
      should I return with disclosures touching Tammany and the inner history of
      that organization, when the dullest must apprehend only trouble and pain
      as the foolish fruits of such garrulity?
    </p>
    <p>
      To the cheer of ones still on the firing lines of Tammany effort, let me
      promise to say no more of them than belongs of necessity to the story of
      my own career. I aim towards the painting of no man's picture save my own.
      Also from first to last I will hold before the face of each old friend the
      shield of an alias and never for a moment in name or feature uncover him
      to the general eye.
    </p>
    <p>
      As to why it pleases me to give the public my Tammany evolution, and
      whether I hope for good or ill therefrom, I am not able to set forth.
      There is that within my bosom to urge me to this work, that much I know;
      the thing uncertain being&mdash;is it vanity, or is it remorse or a hunger
      for sympathy to so ride me and force my frankness to top-speed? There
      comes one thought: however black that robe of reputation which the truth
      weaves for me, it will seem milk-white when laid side by side with what
      Mendacity has invented and Malice sworn to as the story of my career.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before I lift the latch of narration, I would have you pardon me a first
      defensive word. Conceiving that, in the theory of politics, whatever the
      practice may discover, there is such a commodity as morals and such a ware
      as truth, and, remembering how much as the Chief of Tammany Hall I have
      been condemned by purists and folk voluble for reform as a fashion of City
      Satan, striving for all that was ebon in local conditions and control, I
      would remind the reader&mdash;hoping his mind to be unbiased and that he
      will hold fairly the scales for me&mdash;that both morals and truth as
      questions will ever depend for their answer on environment and point of
      view. The morality of one man is the sin of another, and the truth in this
      mouth is the serpent lie in that. Having said this much, let me now go
      forward without more of flourish or time to be eaten up with words.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER I&mdash;HOW THE BOSS CAME TO NEW YORK
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">M</span>Y father was a
      blacksmith, and he and my mother came out of Clonmel, where I myself was
      born. There were four to our family, for besides my father and mother, I
      owned a sister named Anne, she being my better in age by a couple of
      years. Anne is dead now, with all those others I have loved, and under the
      grass roots; but while she lived&mdash;and she did not pass until after I
      had reached the size and manners of a man&mdash;she abode a sort of second
      mother to me, and the littlest of my interests was her chief concern.
    </p>
    <p>
      That Anne was thus tenderly about my destinies, worked doubtless a deal of
      fortunate good to me. By nature, while nothing vicious, I was as lawless
      as a savage; and being resentful of boundaries and as set for liberty as
      water down hill, I needed her influence to hold me in some quiet order.
      That I have the least of letters is due wholly to Anne, for school stood
      to me, child and boy, as hateful as a rainy day, and it was only by her
      going with me to sit by my side and show me my blurred way across the page
      that I would mind my book at all.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was upon a day rearward more than fifty years when my father, gathering
      together our slight belongings, took us aboard ship for America. We were
      six weeks between Queenstown and New York; the ship my father chose used
      sails, and there arose unfriendly seas and winds to baffle us and set us
      back. For myself, I hold no clear memory of that voyage, since I was but
      seven at the time. Nor could I have been called good company; I wept every
      foot of the way, being sick from shore to shore, having no more stomach to
      put to sea with then than I have now.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was eight of the clock on a certain July night that my father, having
      about him my mother and Anne and myself, came ashore at Castle Garden. It
      being dark, and none to meet us nor place for us to seek, we slept that
      night, with our coats to be a bed to us, on the Castle Garden flags. If
      there were hardship to lurk in thus making a couch of the stone floors, I
      missed the notice of it; I was as sound asleep as a tree at midnight when
      we came out of the ship and for eight hours thereafter, never once opening
      my eyes to that new world till the sun was up.
    </p>
    <p>
      Indeed, one may call it in all candor a new world! The more since, by the
      grace of accident, that first day fell upon the fourth of the month, and
      it was the near, persistent roar of cannon all about us, beginning with
      the break of day, to frighten away our sleep. My father and mother were as
      simple as was I, myself, on questions of Western story, and the fact of
      the Fourth of July told no news to them. Guns boomed; flags flaunted;
      bands of music brayed; gay troops went marching hither and yon; crackers
      sputtered and snapped; orators with iron throats swept down on spellbound
      crowds in gales of red-faced eloquence; flaming rockets when the sun went
      down streaked the night with fire! To these manifestations my father and
      the balance of us gave admiring ear and eye; although we were a trifle
      awed by the vehemence of an existence in which we planned to have our
      part, for we took what we heard and witnessed to be the everyday life of
      the place.
    </p>
    <p>
      My father was by trade a blacksmith, and one fair of his craft. Neither he
      nor my mother had much learning; but they were peaceful, sober folk with a
      bent for work; and being sure, rain or shine, to go to church, and strict
      in all their duties, they were ones to have a standing with the clergy and
      the neighbors, It tells well for my father that within the forty-eight
      hours to follow our landing at Castle Garden, he had a roof above our
      heads, and an anvil to hammer upon; this latter at a wage double the best
      that Clonmel might offer even in a dream. And so we began to settle to our
      surroundings, and to match with them, and fit them to ourselves; with each
      day Clonmel to gather a dimness, and we to seem less strange and more at
      home, and in the last to feel as naturally of America as though we had
      been born upon the soil.
    </p>
    <p>
      It has found prior intimation that my earlier years ran as wild as a colt,
      with no strong power save Anne's to tempt me in a right direction. My
      father, so far as his mood might promise, would have led me in paths I
      should go; but he was never sharp to a condition, and with nothing to him
      alert or quick he was one easily fooled, and I dealt with him as I would.
      Moreover, he had his hands filled with the task of the family's support;
      for while he took more in wage for his day's work than had ever come to
      him before, the cost to live had equal promotion, and it is to be doubted
      if any New York Monday discovered him with riches in his pocket beyond
      what would have dwelt there had he stayed in Clonmel. But whether he
      lacked temper or time, and whatever the argument, he cracked no thong of
      authority over me; I worked out my days by patterns to please myself, with
      never a word from him to check or guide me.
    </p>
    <p>
      And my mother was the same. She had her house to care for; and in a
      wash-tub day, and one when sewing machines were yet to find their birth, a
      woman with a family to be a cook to, and she of a taste besides to see
      them clothed and clean, would find her every waking hour engaged. She was
      a housekeeper of celebration, was my mother, and a star for neighboring
      wives to steer by; with floor and walls and everything about her as spick
      and span as scouring soap and lye might make them. Pale, work-worn, I
      still carry her on the skyline of my memory; and I recall how her eye
      would light and her gray cheek show a flush when the priest did us the
      credit of supper at our board, my father pulling down his sleeves over his
      great hairy arms in deference to the exalted station of the guest. It
      comes to this, however, that both my father and my mother, in their narrow
      simplicities and time taken up with the merest arts of living, had neither
      care nor commands for me. I came and I went by my own clock, and if I gave
      the business thought, it was a thought of gratitude to find myself so
      free.
    </p>
    <p>
      To be sure I went now and then to my lessons. Anne had been brisk to seek
      forth a school; for she refused to grow up in ignorance, and even
      cherished a plan to one day teach classes from a book herself. Being
      established, she drew me after her, using both persuasion and force to
      that end, and to keep me in a way of enlightenment, invented a system of
      rewards and punishments, mainly the former, by which according to my merit
      I was to suffer or gain.
    </p>
    <p>
      This temple of learning to which Anne lured me was nothing vast, being no
      bigger than one room. In lieu of a blackboard there was a box of clean
      white sand wherewith to teach dullards of my age and sort their alphabet.
      That feat of education the pedagogue in charge&mdash;a somber personage,
      he, and full of bitter muscularities&mdash;accomplished by tracing the
      letter in the sand. This he did with the point of a hickory ruler, which
      weapon was never out of his hand, and served in moments of thickness as a
      wand of inspiration, being laid across the dull one's back by way of
      brightening his wits. More than once I was made wiser in this fashion; and
      I found such stimulus to go much against the grain and to grievously rub
      wrong-wise the fur of my fancy.
    </p>
    <p>
      These hickory drubbings to make me quicker, falling as thickly as
      October's leaves, went short of their purpose. On the heels of one of them
      I would run from my lessons for a week on end. To be brief with these
      matters of schools and books and alphabets and hickory beatings, I went to
      my classes for a day, only to hide from them for a week; as might be
      guessed, the system collected but a scanty erudition.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is a pity, too: that question of education cannot too much invite an
      emphasis. It is only when one is young that one may be book-taught, just
      as the time of spring is the time for seed. There goes a byword of an old
      dog and a new trick, and I should say it meant a man when he is thirty or
      forty with a book; for, though driven by all the power of shame, I in vain
      strove with.
    </p>
    <p>
      What was utmost in me to repair in middle years the loss of those
      schooldays wasted away. I could come by no advance; the currents of
      habitual ignorance were too strong and I made no head against them. You
      think I pause a deal over my want of letters? I tell you it is the thing I
      have most mourned in all my life.
    </p>
    <p>
      When a fugitive from lessons, I would stay away from my home. This was
      because I must manage an escape from Anne; should she find me I was lost,
      and nothing for it save to be dragged again to school. The look of grief
      in her brown eyes meant ever defeat for me. My only safety was to turn
      myself out of doors and play the exile.
    </p>
    <p>
      This vagabondage was pleasant enough, since it served to feed my native
      vagrancy of temper. And I fared well, too; for I grew into a kind of
      cateran, and was out of my sleeping lair with the sun to follow the
      milkman and baker on their rounds. Coming betimes to the doors of
      customers who still snored between their sheets, these merchants left
      their wares in areas. That was all my worst need asked; by what time they
      doubled the nearest corner I had made my swoop and was fed for the whole
      of a day.
    </p>
    <p>
      Moreover, I knew a way to pick up coppers. On a nearby corner in the
      Bowery a great auction of horses was going. Being light and little, and
      having besides a lively inclination for horses, I was thrown upon the
      backs of ones put up for sale to show their paces. For each of these
      mounts I came the better off by five cents, and on lucky days have made as
      much as the half of a dollar at that trade. As for a bed, if it were
      summer time, what should be finer than the docks? Or if winter, then the
      fire-rooms of the tugs, with the engineers and stokers whereof I made it
      my care to be friendly? I was always ready to throw off a line, or polish
      a lantern, or, when a tug was at the wharf, run to the nearest tap-room
      and fetch a pail of beer; for which good deeds the East River went thickly
      dotted of my allies before ever I touched the age of ten.
    </p>
    <p>
      These meager etchings give some picture of what was my earlier life, the
      major share of which I ran wild about the streets. Neither my father nor
      my mother lived in any command of me, and the parish priest failed as
      dismally as did they when he sought to confine my conduct to a rule. That
      hickory-wielding dominie, with his sandbox and alphabet, was a priest; and
      he gave me such a distaste of the clergy that I rolled away from their
      touch like quicksilver. Anne's tears and the soft voice of her were what I
      feared, and so I kept as much as possible beyond their spell.
    </p>
    <p>
      Coming now to a day when I began first to consider existence as a problem
      serious, I must tell you how my lone sole claim to eminence abode in the
      fact that, lung and limb, I was as strong and tireless as any bison or any
      bear. It was my capital, my one virtue, the mark that set me above my
      fellows. This story of vast strength sounds the more strange, since I was
      under rather than above the common height, and never, until when in later
      life I took on a thickness of fat, scaled heavier than one hundred and
      forty pounds. Thus it stood, however, that my muscle strength, even as a
      youth, went so far beyond what might be called legitimate that it became
      as a proverb in the mouths of people. The gift was a kind of genius; I
      tell of it particularly because it turned to be the ladder whereby I
      climbed into the first of my fortunes. Without it, sure, I never would
      have lifted myself above the gutter levels of my mates, nor fingered a
      splinter of those millions that now lie banked and waiting to my name and
      hand.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER II&mdash;THE BOSS MEETS WITH POLITICS
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">I</span>T was when I was
      in my fifteenth year that face to face I first met politics. Or to fit the
      phrase more nearly with the fact, I should say it was then when politics
      met me. Nor was that meeting in its incident one soon to slip from memory.
      It carried for a darkling element the locking of me in a graceless cell,
      and that is an adventure sure to leave its impress. The more if one be
      young, since the trail of events is ever deepest where the ground is soft.
      It is no wonder the business lies in my mind like a black cameo. It was my
      first captivity, and there will come on one no greater horror than seizes
      him when for the earliest time he hears bars and bolts grate home behind
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      On that day, had one found and measured me he would not have called me a
      child of thoughts or books or alcoves. My nature was as unkempt as the
      streets. Still, in a turbid way and to broadest banks, the currents of my
      sentiment were running for honesty and truth. Also, while I wasted no
      space over the question, I took it as I took the skies above me that law
      was for folk guilty of wrong, while justice even against odds of power
      would never fail the weak and right. My eyes were to be opened; I was to
      be shown the lesson of Tammany, and how law would bend and judges bow
      before the mighty breath of the machine.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was in the long shadows of an August afternoon when the Southhampton
      boat was docked&mdash;a clipper of the Black Ball line. I stood looking
      on; my leisure was spent about the river front, for I was as fond of the
      water as a petrel. The passengers came thronging down the gang-plank; once
      ashore, many of the poorer steerage sort stood about in misty
      bewilderment, not knowing the way to turn or where to go.
    </p>
    <p>
      In that far day a special trade had grown up among the piers; the men to
      follow it were called hotel runners. These birds of prey met the ships to
      swoop on newcomers with lie and cheat, and carry them away to hostelries
      whose mean interests they served. These latter were the poorest in town,
      besides being often dens of wickedness.
    </p>
    <p>
      As I moved boy-like in and out among the waiting groups of immigrants, a
      girl called to me. This girl was English, with yellow hair, and cheeks red
      as apples. I remember I thought her beautiful, and was the more to notice
      it since she seemed no older than myself. She was stark alone and a trifle
      frightened.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Boy,&rdquo; said Apple Cheek, &ldquo;boy, where can I go for to-night? I have money,
      though not much, so it must not be a dear place.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Before I could set my tongue to a reply, a runner known as Sheeny Joe had
      Apple Cheek by the arm and was for leading her away.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come with me,&rdquo; said Sheeny Joe to Apple Cheek; &ldquo;I will show you to a
      house, as neat as pins, and quiet as a church; kept it is by a Christian
      lady as wears out her eyes with searching of the scriptures. You can stay
      there as long as ever you likes for two shillin' a day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This was reeled off by Sheeny Joe with a suave softness like the flow of
      treacle. He was cunning enough to give the charge in shillings so as to
      match the British ear and education of poor Apple Cheek.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where is this place?&rdquo; asked Apple Cheek. I could see how she shrunk from
      Sheeny Joe, with his eyes greedy and black, and small and shiny like the
      eyes of a rat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You wouldn't know the place, young lady,&rdquo; returned Sheeny Joe; &ldquo;but it's
      all right, with prayers and that sort of thing, both night and mornin'.
      It's in Water Street, the place is. Number blank, Water Street,&rdquo; repeated
      Sheeny Joe, giving a resort known as the Dead Rabbit. &ldquo;Come; which ones is
      your bundles? I'll help you carry them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Now by general word, the Dead Rabbit was not unknown to me. It was neither
      tavern nor boarding house, but a mill of vice, with blood on its doorstep
      and worse inside. If ever prayers were said there they must have been
      parcel of some Black Sanctus; and if ever a Christian went there it was to
      be robbed and beaten, and then mayhap to have his throat cut for a lesson
      in silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don't want to go to that house,&rdquo; said I, finding my voice and turning
      to Apple Cheek. &ldquo;You come to my mother's; my sister will find you a place
      to stay. The house he's talkin' about&rdquo;&mdash;here I indicated Sheeny Joe&mdash;&ldquo;aint
      no tavern. It's a boozin' ken for crimps and thieves.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Without a word, Sheeny Joe aimed a swinging blow at my head: Apple Cheek
      gave a low scream. While somewhat unprepared for Sheeny Joe's attack, it
      falling so sharply sudden, I was not to be found asleep; nor would I prove
      a simple conquest even to a grown man. My sinister strength, almost the
      strength of a gorilla, would stand my friend.
    </p>
    <p>
      Quick as a goat on my feet, and as soon to see a storm coming up as any
      sailor, I leaped backward from the blow; and next, before Sheeny Joe
      recovered himself, I was upon him with a wrestler's twitch and trip that
      tossed him high in the air like a rag. He struck on his head and
      shoulders, the chimb of a cask against which he rolled cutting a fine gash
      in his scalp.
    </p>
    <p>
      With a whirl of oaths, Sheeny Joe tried to scramble to his feet; he was
      shaken with rage and wonder to be thus outfaced and worsted by a boy. As
      he gained his knees, and before he might straighten to his ignoble feet, I
      dealt him a crashing blow between the eyes, or rather, on the bridge of
      the nose, which latter feature for Sheeny Joe grew curved and beaky. The
      blow was of the sort that boxers style a &ldquo;hook,&rdquo; and one nothing good to
      stop. Over Sheeny Joe went with the kicking force of it, and lay against
      the tier of casks, bleeding like tragedy, beaten, and yelling &ldquo;murder!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sheeny Joe, bleeding and roaring, and I by no means glutted, but still
      hungry for his harm, were instantly the center of a gaping crowd that came
      about us like a whirlpool. With the others arrived an officer of the
      police.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;W'at's the row here?&rdquo; demanded the officer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Take him to the station!&rdquo; cried Sheeny Joe, picking himself up, a
      dripping picture of blood; &ldquo;he struck me with a knuckle duster.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not so fast, officer,&rdquo; put in a reputable old gentleman. &ldquo;Hear the lad's
      story first. The fellow was saying something to this girl. Nor does he
      look as though it could have been for her benefit.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell me about it, youngster,&rdquo; said the officer, not unkindly. My age and
      weight, as against those of Sheeny Joe, told with this agent of the peace,
      who at heart was a fair man. &ldquo;Tell me what there is to this shindy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why don't you take him in?&rdquo; screamed Sheeny Joe. &ldquo;W'at have you to do
      with his story?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, there's two ends to an alley,&rdquo; retorted the officer warmly. &ldquo;I'll
      hear what the boy has to say. Do you think you're goin' to do all the
      talkin'?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The first thing you'll know,&rdquo; cried Sheeny Joe fiercely, &ldquo;I'll have them
      pewter buttons off your coat.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, you will!&rdquo; retorted the officer with a scowl. &ldquo;Now just for that I'll
      take you in. A night in the jug will put the soft pedal on that mouth of
      yours.&rdquo; With that, the bluecoat seized Sheeny Joe, and there we were, one
      in each of his hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      For myself, I had not uttered a syllable. I was ever slow of speech, and
      far better with my hands than my tongue. Apple Cheek, the cause of the
      war, stood weeping not a yard away; perhaps she was thinking, if her
      confusion allowed her thought, of the savageries of this new land to which
      she was come. Apple Cheek might have taken herself from out the hubbub by
      merely merging with the crowd; I think she had the coolness to do this,
      but was too loyal. She owned the spirit, as it stood, to come forward when
      I would not say a word to tell the officer the story. Apple Cheek was
      encouraged to this steadiness by the reputable old gentleman.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before, however, Apple Cheek could win to the end of the first sentence, a
      burly figure of a man, red of face and broad as a door across the
      shoulders, pushed his way through the crowd.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; he asked, coming in front of the officer. &ldquo;Turn that man
      loose,&rdquo; he continued, pointing to Sheeny Joe.
    </p>
    <p>
      The red-faced man spoke in a low tone, but one of cool command. The
      officer, however, was not to be readily driven from his ground; he was new
      to the place and by nature an honest soul. Still, he felt an atmosphere of
      power about the red-faced personage; wherefore, while he kept strictest
      hold on both Sheeny Joe and myself, he was not wanting of respect in his
      response.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;These two coves are under arrest,&rdquo; said the officer, shaking Sheeny Joe
      and myself like rugs by way of identification.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know,&rdquo; said the other, still in the low cool tone. &ldquo;All the same, you
      turn this one loose.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The officer still hesitated with a look of half-defiance. With that the
      red-faced man lost temper.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Take your hands off him, I tell you!&rdquo; cried the redfaced man, a spark of
      anger showing in his small gray eyes. &ldquo;Do you know me? I'm Big Kennedy.
      Did you never hear of Big John Kennedy of Tammany Hall? You do what I say,
      or I'll have you out in Harlem with the goats before to-morrow night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With that, he of the red face took Sheeny Joe from between the officer's
      fingers; nor did the latter seek to detain him. The frown of authority
      left his brow, and his whole face became overcast with a look of surly
      submission.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You should have said so at the jump,&rdquo; remarked the officer sullenly. &ldquo;How
      was I to know who you are?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You're all right,&rdquo; returned the red-faced one, lapsing into an easy
      smile. &ldquo;You're new to this stroll; you'll be wiser by an' by.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What'll I do with the boy?&rdquo; asked the officer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Officer,&rdquo; broke in the reputable old gentleman, who was purple to the
      point apoplectic; &ldquo;officer, do you mean that you will take your orders
      from this man?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, my old codger,&rdquo; interrupted the red-faced one loftily, &ldquo;stow that.
      You had better sherry for Fift' Avenue where you belong. If you don't, th'
      gang down here may get tired, d'ye see, an' put you in the river.&rdquo; Then to
      the officer: &ldquo;Take the boy in; I'll look him over later.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An' the girl!&rdquo; screamed Sheeny Joe. &ldquo;I want her lagged too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An' the girl, officer,&rdquo; commanded the red-faced one. &ldquo;Take her along with
      the boy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Thus was the procession made up; the officer led Apple Cheek and myself to
      the station, with Sheeny Joe, still bleeding, and the red-faced man to be
      his backer, bringing up the rear.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the station it was like the whirl and roar of some storm to me. It was
      my first captivity&mdash;my first collision with the police, and my wits
      were upside down. I recall that a crowd of people followed us, and were
      made to stand outside the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      The reputable old gentleman came also, and tried to interefere in behalf
      of Apple Cheek and myself. At a sign from the red-faced man, who stood
      leaning on the captain's desk with all the confidence of life, that
      potentate gave his sharp command.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Screw out!&rdquo; cried he, to the reputable old gentleman. &ldquo;We don't want any
      of your talk!&rdquo; Then to an officer in the station: &ldquo;Put him out!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm a taxpayer!&rdquo; shouted the reputable old gentleman furiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You'll pay a fine,&rdquo; responded the captain with a laugh, &ldquo;if you kick up a
      row 'round my station. Now screw out, or I'll put you the wrong side of
      the grate.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The reputable old gentleman was thrust into the street with about as much
      ceremony as might attend the delivery of a bale of goods at one's door. He
      disappeared, declaring he would have justice; at which a smile widened the
      faces of the sophisticated officers, several of whom were lounging about
      the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He'll have justice!&rdquo; repeated the captain with a chuckle. &ldquo;Say! he aought
      to put that in the Joe Miller Joke-book.&rdquo; Then to the red-faced man, who
      still leaned against the desk, the image of autocracy sure of itself:
      &ldquo;What is it to be, Mr. Kennedy?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why,&rdquo; quoth the red-faced one, &ldquo;you must lock this boy up. Yes, an' the
      girl, too; she had better go in for the night. I'll take a look into th'
      business, an' let the judge know in the mornin'.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't think, captain,&rdquo; interposed the officer who brought us from the
      docks, &ldquo;there's any use locking up these people. It was nothin' but a
      cheap muss on the pier.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Say! I don't stand that!&rdquo; broke in Sheeny Joe. &ldquo;This party smashed me
      with a bar of iron. The girl was in the play; an' I say they're both to go
      in.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You 'say,'&rdquo; mocked the captain, in high scorn. &ldquo;An' who are you? Who is
      this fellow?&rdquo; he demanded, looking about him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He's one of my people,&rdquo; said the red-faced man, still coolly by the desk.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No more out of you!&rdquo; snarled the captain to the kindly officer, as the
      latter again tried to speak; &ldquo;you get back to your beat!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An' say!&rdquo; cried the red-faced man, slowly rousing from his position by
      the desk; &ldquo;before you go, let me give you a word. You're a sight too
      gabby; you had better think more and say less, or you won't last long
      enough as a copper to wear out that new uniform. An' if anybody asks, tell
      him it was Big Kennedy that told you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They led me to a cell, while poor Apple Cheek, almost fainting, was
      carried to another. As I was being taken away, Anne came rushing in. Bad
      news is a creature of wings, and Anne had been told my adventures by a
      small urchin who ran himself nearly to death in defeating two fellow
      urchins for the privilege before I had reached the station.
    </p>
    <p>
      Anne did not observe me as she came in, for I stood somewhat to the rear,
      with several turnkeys and officers between. I could see the white face of
      her, and how the lamps of a great alarm were lighted in her eyes. Her
      voice was so low with terror I could not hear her words. Evidently she was
      pleading, girl-fashion, for my liberty. The tones of the captain, however,
      rose clear and high.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That'll do ye now,&rdquo; said he in a manner of lordly insolence, looking up
      from the desk to which he had returned. &ldquo;If we put a prisoner on the
      pavement every time a good-looking girl rushed in with a yarn about bein'
      his sister, we wouldn't need no cells at all. This boy stays till the
      judge takes a look at him in the mornin'. Meanwhile, you had better get
      back to your window, or all the men will have left the street.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At this, a mighty anger flamed up in my heart. I tore away from the
      officer who had me by the shoulders, and, save that three others as
      practiced in the sleight of it as football players instantly seized me, I
      should have gone straight at the captain's neck like a bulldog.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll have his life!&rdquo; I foamed.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next moment I was thrown into a cell. The door slammed; the lock shot
      home; with that, my heart seemed to turn to water in my bosom and I sank
      upon the stone floor of my cage.

      CHAPTER III&mdash;THE BOSS SEES THE POWER OF TAMMANY
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>HAT night under
      lock and key was a night of laughed and screamed like bedlam. Once I heard
      the low click of sobs, and thought it might be poor unhappy Apple Cheek.
      The surmise went wide, for she was held in another part of the prison.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was in the first streaks of the morning before I slept. My slumbers did
      not last long; it seemed as though I had but shut my eyes when a loud rap
      of iron on iron brought me up, and there stood one armed of a key so large
      it might have done for the gate of a giant's castle. It was this man
      hammering with his weapon on the grate of my cell that roused me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now then, young gallows-bird,&rdquo; said the functionary, &ldquo;be you ready for
      court?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The man, while rough, gave me no hard impression, for he wore a tolerant
      grin and had eyes of friendly brown. These amiable signs endowed me with
      courage to ask a question.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What will they do with me?&rdquo; I queried. I was long delirium. Drunken men
      babbled and cursed and shouted; while a lunatic creature anxious, for I
      had no experience to be my guide. &ldquo;What will they do? Will they let me
      go?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sure! they'll let you go.&rdquo; My hopes gained their feet. &ldquo;To Blackwell's.&rdquo;
       My hopes lay prone again.
    </p>
    <p>
      The turnkey, for such was the man's station, had but humored me with one
      of the stock jokes of the place. On seeing my distress, and perhaps
      remembering that I should be something tender if years were to count, and
      no frequent tenant of the cells with sensibilities trained to the safe
      consistency of leather, he made me further reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I'll tell you the truth, youngster. If you plead guilty, an' there's
      no one there but the cop, it'll be about ten dollars or twenty days on the
      Island. But if Sheeny Joe comes 'round to exhibit his nose, or Big Kennedy
      shows up to stall ag'inst you, why I should say you might take six months
      and call yourself in luck.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was nothing to brighten the eye in the story, and my ribs seemed to
      inclose a heart of wood.
    </p>
    <p>
      With a vile dozen to be my companions, frowsy, bleary creatures, some
      shaking with the dumb ague of drink whose fires had died out, I was driven
      along a narrow corridor, up a pair of stairs, and into a room of
      respectable size! Its dimensions, however, would be its only claim to
      respectability, for the walls and ceiling were smoke-blackened, while the
      floor might have come the better off for a pailful of soap and water.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once within the room I found myself in a railed pen. Against the wall,
      with a desk before him and raised above the herd by a platform, sat the
      magistrate. There was a fence which divided the big room, and beyond and
      leaning on it lolled the public, leering and listening, as hard an array
      as one might wish to see. One might have sentenced the entire roomful to
      the workhouse and made few mistakes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Inside this fence, and gathered for the most part about the magistrate,
      were those who had business with the court; officers, witnesses, friends
      and enemies of the accused, with last although not least a collection of
      the talent of the bar. Many of these latter were brisk Jews, and all of
      them were marked by soiled linen, frayed elbows, greasy collars, and an
      evident carelessness as to the state of their hands and faces. There were
      boys to wait on these folk of law, a boy to each I should say. None of
      these urchins was older than was I, and some no more than twelve. They
      carried baize bags, chatted gravely while waiting the call of their
      masters, and gave themselves strutting airs and brows of consequence.
      These engaging children, in a spirit of loyalty, doubtless, showed
      themselves as untainted of water as were their betters.
    </p>
    <p>
      While I rehearse these sordid appearances as developed in the dim lights
      which through the grimy windows fell across the scene, you are not to
      suppose the notice of them preyed upon me. I was, in that hour, neither so
      squeamish nor so observant as to make particular note of them, nor was I
      to that degree the slave of soap in my own roving person, as to justify
      the risk of strictures which might provoke retort. Besides, I was thinking
      dolefully on that trip to Blackwell's Island whereof the future seemed so
      full, and my eyes scanned the judge on the bench rather than lesser folk
      who were not so important in my affairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      While in the mills of great misery, still I was steady enough. I turned my
      gaze upon the magistrate, and sought in his looks and words, as he went
      about the sorry destinies of other delinquents, some slant of what I might
      look forward to for myself. The dignitary in question showed lean and
      sallow and bald, with a sly face and an eye whereof the great expression
      was one of sleepless self-interest. He did not come upon you as either
      brave or good, but he had nothing brutal or vindictive, and his timid
      mealy voice was shaken by a quaver that seemed a perpetual apology for
      what judgments he from time to time would pass. His sentences were
      invariably light, except in instances where some strong influence from the
      outside, generally a politician or the agent of a big company, arose to
      demand severity.
    </p>
    <p>
      While within the railed pen with those other unfortunates whom the
      dragnets of the police had brought to these mean shores, and in an
      interval when my fascinated eyes were off the magistrate, I caught sight
      of Anne and my father. They had seats inside the fence. The latter's face
      was clouded with simple trouble; he wore his Sunday coat, and his hands,
      hard and showing the stains of his forge, roved in uneasy alternation from
      his pockets to his lapels and back again. Anne's young eyes were worn and
      tired, for she had slept as little as had I and wept much more the night
      before. I could not discover Apple Cheek, although I looked about the room
      for her more than once. I had it in my hopes that they had given Apple
      Cheek her freedom, and the thought was a half-relief. Nothing of such
      decent sort had come to pass, however; Apple Cheek was waiting with two or
      three harridans, her comrades of the cells, in an adjoining room.
    </p>
    <p>
      When my name was called, an officer of the court opened a gate in the
      prisoner's pen and motioned me to come forth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hurry up!&rdquo; said the officer, who was for expedition. &ldquo;W'at's the trouble
      with your heels? You aint got no ball an' chain on yet, you know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then he gave me a chair in front of the magistrate, where the man of power
      might run me up and down with his shifty deprecatory eye.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There was a girl brought in with him, your honor,&rdquo; remarked the officer
      at the gate.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have her out, then,&rdquo; said the magistrate; whereupon Apple Cheek, a bit
      disheveled and cheeks redder than ever with the tears she had shed, was
      produced and given a seat by my side.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who complains of these defendants?&rdquo; asked the magistrate in a mild
      non-committal voice, glancing about the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do, your honor.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was Sheeny Joe who came pushing to the fore from a far corner. His head
      had received the benefit of several bandages, and it gave me a dullish joy
      to think it was I to furnish the reason of them.
    </p>
    <p>
      The magistrate appeared to know Sheeny Joe, and to hold him in regard at
      that. The moment my enemy declared himself as the complainant, and no one
      springing up to take my part, the magistrate bent upon me a stony glance
      that spoke plainly of those six months concerning which the turnkey told.
      I gave up everything, myself and Apple Cheek, as surely lost.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell your story,&rdquo; said the magistrate to Sheeny Joe. His manner was full
      of commiseration for that unworthy. &ldquo;What did he assault you with?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;With a blackjack, your honor, or a piece of lead pipe,&rdquo; replied Sheeny
      Joe. &ldquo;He struck me when I wasn't lookin'. I'm busy trying to tell the girl
      there w'at hotel she wants. He gives it to me over the head from behind;
      then as I wheels, he smashes me across the nose. I couldn't see with w'at,
      but it was a bar of some kind, mebby iron, mebby lead. As I goes down, I
      hears the sketch&mdash;the girl, I mean&mdash;sing out, 'Kill him!' The
      girl was eggin' him on, your honor.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sheeny Joe unwound this string of lies without hitch or pause, and withal
      so rapidly it fair stole my breath away. I felt the eyes of the magistrate
      upon me; I knew my danger and yet could come by no words for my own
      defense. I make no doubt, had it not been for a diversion as unlooked-for
      as it was welcome, I would have been marked for prison where I stood.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I demand to be heard,&rdquo; came suddenly, in a high angry voice. &ldquo;What that
      rogue has just uttered is all a pack of lies together!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was the reputable old gentleman of the evening before who thus threw
      himself in the way of events. Being escorted through the press of
      onlookers by an officer, the reputable old gentleman stood squarely in
      front of the magistrate.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I demand justice for that boy,&rdquo; fumed the reputable old gentleman,
      glaring at the magistrate, and growing crimson in the face; &ldquo;I demand a
      jury. As for the girl, she wasn't ten minutes off the boat; her only part
      in the offense would seem to be that this scoundrel,&rdquo; pointing to Sheeny
      Joe, &ldquo;was striving to lure her to a low resort.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Dead Rabbit a low resort!&rdquo; cried Sheeny
    </p>
    <p>
      Joe indignantly. &ldquo;The place is as straight as a gun.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you please tell me who you are?&rdquo; asked the magistrate of the
      reputable old gentleman. He had resumed his non-committal look. The
      confident vigor of the reputable old gentleman disconcerted him and made
      him wary.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am a taxpayer,&rdquo; said the reputable old gentleman; &ldquo;yes,&rdquo; donning an air
      as though the thunders and lightnings of politics dwelt in the word, &ldquo;yes,
      your honor, a taxpayer. I do not know this boy, but here are his father
      and sister to speak for him.&rdquo; Then, as he caught sight of the captain who
      had ordered him out of the station: &ldquo;There is a man, your honor, who by
      the hands of his minions drove me from a public police office&mdash;me, a
      taxpayer!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The captain grinned easily to find himself thus distinguished. The grin
      irritated the reputable old gentleman, who was even more peppery than
      reputable.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Smile, sir!&rdquo; cried the reputable old gentleman, shaking his wrathful
      finger at the captain. &ldquo;I shall have you before your superiors on charges
      before I'm done!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's what they all say,&rdquo; remarked the captain, stifling a yawn.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One thing at a time, sir,&rdquo; said the magistrate to the reputable old
      gentleman. His attitude was wheedling and propitiatory. &ldquo;Did I understand
      you to say that the gentleman and the lady at your back are the father and
      sister of this boy?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      My father and Anne had taken their stations to the rear of the reputable
      old gentleman. The latter, looking around as if to identify them, replied:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If the court please, I'm told so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your honor,&rdquo; broke in Sheeny Joe with a front of injury, &ldquo;w'at's that got
      to do with his sandbaggin' me? Am I to be murdered w'en peacefully about
      me business, just 'cause a guy's got a father?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What were you saying to this girl?&rdquo; asked the magistrate mildly of Sheeny
      Joe, and indicating Apple Cheek with his eye where she sat tearful and
      frightened by my side. &ldquo;This gentleman&rdquo;&mdash;the reputable old gentleman
      snorted fiercely&mdash;&ldquo;declares that you were about to lure her to a low
      resort.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your honor, it was the Dead Rabbit,&rdquo; said Sheeny Joe.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is the Dead Rabbit,&rdquo; observed the magistrate, to the captain, who was
      still lounging about, &ldquo;is the Dead Rabbit a place of good repute?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It aint no Astor House,&rdquo; replied the captain, &ldquo;but no one expects an
      Astor House in Water Street.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it a resort for thieves?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The magistrate still advanced his queries in a fashion apologetic and
      subdued. The reputable old gentleman impressed him as one he would not
      like to offend. Then, too, there was my father&mdash;an honest working-man
      by plain testimony of his face. On the other hand stood Sheeny Joe, broken
      of nose, bandaged, implacable. Here were three forces of politics,
      according to our magistrate, who was thinking on a re-election; he would
      prefer to please them all. Obviously, he in no sort delighted in his
      present position, since whichever way he turned it might be a turn toward
      future disaster for himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is the Dead Rabbit a resort for thieves?&rdquo; again asked the magistrate.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; replied the captain judgmatically, &ldquo;even a crook has got to go
      somewhere. That is,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;when he aint in hock.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Where this criss-cross colloquy of justice or injustice might have left
      me, and whether free or captive, I may only guess. The proceedings were to
      gain another and a final interruption. This time it was the red-faced man,
      he who had called himself &ldquo;Big Kennedy,&rdquo; to come panting into the presence
      of the court. The red-faced man had hurried up the stairs, three steps at
      a time, and it told upon his breathing.
    </p>
    <p>
      The magistrate made a most profound bow to the red-faced man. Remembering
      the somber prophecy of him with the big key, should &ldquo;Big Kennedy show up
      to Stall ag'inst me,&rdquo; my hope, which had revived with the stand taken by
      the reputable old gentleman, sunk now to lowest marks.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What will you have, Mr. Kennedy?&rdquo; purred the magistrate obsequiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is the court going to dispose of the cases of this boy and this girl?&rdquo;
       interrupted the reputable old gentleman warmly. &ldquo;I demand a jury trial for
      both of them. I am a taxpayer and propose to have justice.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hold up, old sport, hold up!&rdquo; exclaimed the redfaced man in cheerful
      tones. He was addressing the reputable old gentleman. &ldquo;Let me get to work.
      I'll settle this thing like throwin' dice.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you mean, sir, by calling me an old sport?&rdquo; demanded the
      reputable old gentleman.
    </p>
    <p>
      The red-faced man did not heed the question, but wheeled briskly on the
      magistrate.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your honor,&rdquo; said the red-faced man, &ldquo;there's nothin' to this. Sheeny Joe
      there has made a misdeal, that's all. I've looked the case over, your
      honor; there's nothin' in it; you can let the girl an' the boy go.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But he said the Dead Rabbit was a drum for crooks!&rdquo; protested Sheeny Joe,
      speaking to the redfaced man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;S'ppose he did,&rdquo; retorted the other, &ldquo;that don't take a dollar out of the
      drawer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An' he's to break my nose an' get away?&rdquo; complained Sheeny Joe.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, you oughter to take care of your nose,&rdquo; said the red-faced man,
      &ldquo;an' not go leavin' it lyin' around where a kid can break it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sheeny Joe was not to be shaken off; he engaged in violent argument with
      the red-faced man. Their tones, however, were now more guarded, and no one
      might hear their words beyond themselves. While this went forward, the
      magistrate, to save his dignity, perhaps, and not to have it look as
      though he were waiting for orders, pretended to be writing in his book of
      cases which lay open on his desk.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was Sheeny Joe to bring the discussion between himself and the
      red-faced man to an end. Throughout the whispered differences between
      them, differences as to what should be my fate, Sheeny Joe showed hot with
      fury, while the red-faced man was cool and conciliatory; his voice when
      one caught some sound of it was coaxing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There's been enough said!&rdquo; cried Sheeny Joe, suddenly walking away from
      the red-faced man. &ldquo;No duck is goin' to break my nose for fun.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The boy's goin' loose,&rdquo; observed the red-faced man in placid
      contradiction. &ldquo;An' the girl goes to her friends, wherever they be, an'
      they aint at the Dead Rabbit.&rdquo; Then in a blink the countenance of the
      redfaced man went from calm to rage. He whirled Sheeny Joe by the
      shoulder. &ldquo;See here!&rdquo; he growled, &ldquo;one more roar out of you, an' I'll
      stand you up right now, an' it's you who will take sixty days, or my name
      aint Big John Kennedy. If you think that's a bluff, call it. Another yeep,
      an' the boat's waitin' for you! You've been due at the Island for some
      time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's all right, Mr. Kennedy!&rdquo; replied Sheeny Joe, his crest falling,
      and the sharpest terror in his face, &ldquo;that's all right! You know me? Of
      course it goes as you say! Did you ever know me to buck ag'inst you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The red-faced man smiled ferociously. The anger faded from his brow, and
      leaving Sheeny Joe without further word, he again spoke to the magistrate.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The charges ag'inst these two children, your honor, are withdrawn.&rdquo; He
      spoke in his old cool tones. &ldquo;Captain,&rdquo; he continued, addressing that
      dignitary, &ldquo;send one of your plain-clothes people with this girl to find
      her friends for her. Tell him he mustn't make any mistakes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The cases are dismissed,&rdquo; said the magistrate, making an entry in his
      book. He appeared relieved with the change in the situation; almost as
      much, if that were possible, as myself. &ldquo;The cases are dismissed; no costs
      to be taxed. I think that is what you desire, Mr. Kennedy?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, your honor.&rdquo; Then coming over to where I sat, the red-faced man
      continued: &ldquo;You hunt me up to-morrow&mdash;Big John Kennedy&mdash;that's
      my name. Any cop can tell you where to find me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir,&rdquo; I answered faintly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There's two things about you,&rdquo; said the red-faced man, rubbing my stubble
      of hair with his big paw, &ldquo;that's great in a boy. You can hit like the
      kick of a pony; an' you can keep your mouth shut. I aint heard a yelp out
      of you, mor'n if you was a Boston terrier.&rdquo; This, admiringly.
    </p>
    <p>
      As we left the magistrate's office&mdash;the red-faced man, the reputable
      old gentleman, my father, Apple Cheek, and myself, with Anne holding my
      hand as though I were some treasure lost and regained&mdash;the reputable
      old gentleman spoke up pompously to the red-faced man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I commend what you have done, sir; but in that connection, and as a
      taxpayer, let me tell you that I resent your attitude towards the
      magistrate. You issued your orders, sir, and conducted yourself toward
      that officer of justice as though you owned him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, what of it?&rdquo; returned the red-faced man composedly. &ldquo;I put him
      there. What do you think I put him there for? To give me the worst of it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sir, I do not understand your expressions!&rdquo; said the reputable old
      gentleman. &ldquo;And I resent them! Yes, sir, I resent them as a taxpayer of
      this town!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Say,&rdquo; observed the red-faced man benignantly, &ldquo;there's nothin' wrong
      about you but your head. You had better take a term or two at night school
      an' get it put on straight. You say you're a taxpayer; you've already
      fired the fact at me about five times. An' now I ask you: Suppose you be?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Taxpayer; yes, sir, taxpayer!&rdquo; repeated the reputable old gentleman, in a
      mighty fume. &ldquo;Do you intend to tell me there's no meaning to the word?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It means,&rdquo; said the red-faced man in the slow manner of one who gives
      instruction; &ldquo;it means that if you're nothin' but a taxpayer&mdash;an' I
      don't think you be or you'd have told us&mdash;you might as well sit down.
      You're a taxpayer, eh? All right; I'm a ward-leader of Tammany Hall.
      You're a taxpayer; good! I'm the man that settles how much you pay, d'ye
      see!&rdquo; Then, as though sympathy and disgust were blended: &ldquo;Old man, you go
      home and take a hard look at the map, and locate yourself. You don't know
      it, but all the same you're in New York.&rdquo;

      CHAPTER IV&mdash;THE BOSS ENTERS THE PRIMARY GRADE OF POLITICS
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">P</span>ERHAPS you will
      say I waste space and lay too much of foolish stress upon my quarrel with
      Sheeny Joe and its police-cell consequences. And yet you should be mindful
      of the incident's importance to me as the starting point of my career. For
      I read in what took place the power of the machine as you will read this
      printed page. I went behind the bars by the word of Big John Kennedy; and
      it was by his word that I emerged and took my liberty again. And yet who
      was Big John Kennedy? He was the machine; the fragment of its power which
      molded history in the little region where I lived. As mere John Kennedy he
      would be nothing. Or at the most no more than other men about him. But as
      &ldquo;Big John Kennedy,&rdquo; an underchief of Tammany Hall, I myself stood witness
      while a captain of police accepted his commands without a question, and a
      magistrate found folk guilty or innocent at the lifting of his finger.
      Also, that sweat of terror to sprinkle the forehead of Sheeny Joe, when in
      his moment of rebellion he found himself beneath the wrathful shadow of
      the machine, was not the least impressive element of my experience; and
      the tolerant smile, that was half pity, half amusement, as Big Kennedy set
      forth to the reputable old gentleman&mdash;who was only &ldquo;a taxpayer&rdquo;&mdash;the
      little limits of his insignificance, deepened the effect upon my mind of
      what had gone before.
    </p>
    <p>
      True, I indulged in no such analysis as the above, and made no study of
      the picture in its detail; but I could receive an impression just as I
      might receive a blow, and in the innocence of my ignorance began instantly
      to model myself upon the proven fact of a power that was above law, above
      justice, and which must be consulted and agreed with, even in its caprice,
      before existence could be profitable or even safe. From that moment the
      machine to me was as obviously and indomitably abroad as the pavement
      under foot, and must have its account in every equation of life to the
      solution whereof I was set. To hold otherwise, and particularly to act
      otherwise, would be to play the fool, with failure or something worse for
      a reward.
    </p>
    <p>
      Big Kennedy owned a drinking place. His barroom was his headquarters;
      although he himself never served among his casks and bottles, having
      barmen for that work. He poured no whisky, tapped no beer, donned no
      apron, but sat at tables with his customers and laid out his campaigns of
      politics or jubilated over victory, and seemed rather the visitor than the
      proprietor in his own saloon. He owned shrewdness, force, courage,
      enterprise, and was one of those who carry a pleasant atmosphere that is
      like hypnotism, and which makes men like them. His manner was one of rude
      frankness, and folk held him for a bluff, blunt, genial soul, who made up
      in generosity what he lacked of truth.
    </p>
    <p>
      And yet I have thought folk mistaken in Big Kennedy. For all his loud
      openness and friendly roar, which would seem to tell his every thought,
      the man could be the soul of cunning and turn secret as a mole. He was for
      his own interest; he came and went a cold calculating trader of politics;
      he never wasted his favors, but must get as much as he gave, and indulged
      in no revenges except when revenge was needed for a lesson. He did what
      men call good, too, and spent money and lost sleep in its accomplishment.
      To the ill he sent doctors and drugs; he found work and wages for idle
      men; he paid landlords and kept the roofs above the heads of the
      penniless; where folk were hungry he sent food, and where they were cold
      came fuel.
    </p>
    <p>
      For all that, it was neither humanity nor any milk of kindness which put
      him to these labors of grace; it was but his method of politics and meant
      to bind men to him. They must do his word; they must carry out his will;
      then it was he took them beneath the wing of his power and would spare
      neither time nor money to protect and prosper them.
    </p>
    <p>
      And on the other side, he who raised his head in opposition to Big Kennedy
      was crushed; not in anger, but in caution. He weeded out rebellion, and
      the very seed of it, with as little scruple and for the same reason a
      farmer weeds a field.
    </p>
    <p>
      It took me years to collect these truths of Big Kennedy. Nor was their
      arrival when they did come one by one, to make a shade of change in my
      regard for him. I liked him in the beginning; I liked him in the end; he
      became that headland on the coasts of politics by which I steered my
      course. I studied Big Kennedy as one might study a science; by the lines
      of his conduct I laid down lines for my own; in all things I was his
      disciple and his imitator.
    </p>
    <p>
      Big Kennedy is dead now; and I will say no worse nor better of him than
      this: He was a natural captain of men. Had he been born to a higher
      station, he might have lighted a wick in history that would require those
      ten thicknesses of darkness which belong with ten centuries, to obscure.
      But no such thing could come in the instance of Big Kennedy; his
      possibilities of eminence, like my own, were confined to Tammany and its
      politics, since he had no more of education than have I. The time has gone
      by in the world at large, and had in Big Kennedy's day, when the ignorant
      man can be the first man.
    </p>
    <p>
      Upon the day following my release, as he had bid me.
    </p>
    <p>
      I sought Big Kennedy. He was in his barroom, and the hour being
      mid-morning I was so far lucky as to find him quite alone. He was quick to
      see me, too, and seemed as full of a pleasant interest in me as though my
      simple looks were of themselves good news. He did most of the talking, for
      I sat backward and bashful, the more since I could feel his sharp eyes
      upon me, taking my measure. Never was I so looked over and so questioned,
      and not many minutes had come and gone before Big Kennedy knew as much of
      me and my belongings as did I myself. Mayhap more; for he weighed me in
      the scales of his experience with all the care of gold, considering
      meanwhile to what uses I should be put, and how far I might be expected to
      advance his ends.
    </p>
    <p>
      One of his words I recall, for it gave me a glow of relief at the time; at
      that it was no true word. It was when he heard how slightly I had been
      taught of books.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never mind,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;books as often as not get between a party's legs
      and trip him up. Better know men than books. There's my library.&rdquo; Here he
      pointed to a group about a beer table. &ldquo;I can learn more by studyin' them
      than was ever found between the covers of a book, and make more out of
      it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Big Kennedy told me I must go to work.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You've got to work, d'ye see,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;if it's only to have an excuse
      for livin'.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then he asked me what I could do. On making nothing clear by my replies&mdash;for
      I knew of nothing&mdash;he descended to particulars.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you know of horses? Can you drive one?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      My eye brightened; I might be trusted to handle a horse.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An' I'll gamble you know your way about the East Side,&rdquo; said he
      confidently; &ldquo;I'll answer for that.&rdquo; Then getting up he started for the
      door, for no grass grew between decision and action with Big Kennedy.
      &ldquo;Come with me,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      We had made no mighty journey when we stopped before a grocery. It was a
      two-store front, and of a prosperous look, with a wealth of vegetables and
      fruits in crates, and baskets, and barrels, covering half the sidewalk.
      The proprietor was a rubicund German, who bustled forth at sight of my
      companion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How is Mr. Kennedy?&rdquo; This with exuberance. &ldquo;It makes me prout that you
      pay me a wisit.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes?&rdquo; said the other dryly. Then, going directly to the point: &ldquo;Here's a
      boy I've brought you, Nick. Let him drive one of your wagons. Give him six
      dollars a week.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, Mr. Kennedy,&rdquo; replied the grocer dubiously, looking me over with the
      tail of his eye, &ldquo;I haf yet no wacancy. My wagons is all full.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm goin' to get him new duds,&rdquo; said Big Kennedy, &ldquo;if that's what you're
      thinkin' about.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Still, the grocer, though not without some show of respectful alarm,
      insisted on a first position.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If he was so well dressed even as you, Mr. Kennedy, yet I haf no
      wacancy,&rdquo; said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then make one,&rdquo; responded Big Kennedy coolly. &ldquo;Dismiss one of the boys
      you have, d'ye see? At least two who work for you don't belong in my
      ward.&rdquo; As the other continued doubtful Big Kennedy became sharp. &ldquo;Come,
      come, come!&rdquo; he cried in a manner peremptory rather than fierce; &ldquo;I can't
      wait all day. Don't you feed your horses in the street? Don't you obstruct
      the sidewalks with your stuff? Don't you sell liquor in your rear room
      without a license? Don't you violate a dozen ordinances? Don't the police
      stand it an' pass you up? An' yet you hold me here fiddlin' and foolin'
      away time!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, yes, Mr. Kennedy,&rdquo; cried the grocer, who from the first had sought
      to stem the torrent of the other's eloquence, &ldquo;I was only try in' to think
      up w'ich horse I will let him drive alreatty. That's honest! sure as my
      name is Nick Fogel!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Clothed in what was to me the splendors of a king, being indeed a full new
      suit bought with Big Kennedy's money, I began rattling about the streets
      with a delivery wagon the very next day. As well as I could, I tried to
      tell my thanks for the clothes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's all right,&rdquo; said Big Kennedy. &ldquo;I owe you that much for havin' you
      chucked into a cell.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      While Grocer Fogel might have been a trifle slow in hiring me, once I was
      engaged he proved amiable enough. I did my work well too, missing few of
      the customers and losing none of the baskets and sacks. Grocer Fogel was
      free with his praise and conceded my value. Still, since he instantly
      built a platform in the street on the strength of my being employed, and
      so violated a new and further ordinance upon which he for long had had an
      eye, I have sometimes thought that in forming his opinion of my worth he
      included this misdemeanor in his calculations. However, I worked with my
      worthy German four years; laying down the reins of that delivery wagon of
      my own will at the age of nineteen.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nor was I without a profit in this trade of delivering potatoes and
      cabbages and kindred grocery forage. It broadened the frontiers of my
      acquaintance, and made known to me many of a solvent middle class, and of
      rather a higher respectability than I might otherwise have met. It served
      to clean up my manners, if nothing more, and before I was done, that
      acquaintance became with me an asset of politics.
    </p>
    <p>
      While I drove wagon for Grocer Fogel, my work of the day was over with six
      o'clock. I had nothing to do with the care of the horses; I threw the
      reins to a stable hand when at evening I went to the barn, and left for my
      home without pausing to see the animals out of the straps or their noses
      into the corn. Now, had I been formed with a genius for it, I might have
      put in a deal of time at study. But nothing could have been more distant
      from my taste or habit; neither then nor later did I engage myself in any
      traffic with books, and throughout my life never opened a half-dozen.
    </p>
    <p>
      Still, considering those plans I had laid down for myself, and that future
      of politics to which my ambition began to consider, I cannot say I threw
      away my leisure. If my nose were not between the pages of a book, my hands
      were within a pair of boxing gloves, and I, engaged against this or that
      opponent, was leading or guarding, hitting or stopping, rushing or getting
      away, and fitting to an utmost hand and foot and eye and muscle for the
      task of beating a foeman black and blue should the accidents or duties of
      life place one before me.
    </p>
    <p>
      And I prospered with my boxing. I think I owned much native stomach for
      the business, since in my sullen fashion I was as near the touch of true
      happiness when in the midst of a mill as ever I hope to stand. My heart,
      and with that word I mean courage, was of fighting sort. While I was
      exceedingly cautious, my caution was based on courage. Men of this stamp
      stay until the last and either conquer or fall. There be ones who have
      courage, but their construction is the other way about. Their courage is
      based on caution; such if hard bested run away. Should you seek the man
      who will stand to the work of battle to the dour end, pick him whose
      caution, coming first in the procession of his nature, is followed by his
      courage, rather than that one whose caution follows his courage to tap it
      on the shoulder, preach to it of peril, and counsel flight.
    </p>
    <p>
      You are not to assume that I went about these boxing gymnastics because of
      any savageries or blood-hunger dominant in my breast, or was moved solely
      of that instinct by which the game-cock fights. I went to my fist-studies
      as the result of thought and calculation. In my slow way I had noted how
      those henchmen of the inner circle who surrounded Big Kennedy&mdash;those
      who were near to him, and upon whom he most relied, were wholly valued by
      him for the two matters of force of fist and that fidelity which asks no
      question. Even a thicker intellect than mine would have seen that to
      succeed as I proposed, I must be the gladiator. Wherefore, I boxed and
      wrestled and perfected my muscles; also as corollary I avoided drink and
      tobacco as I would two poisons.
    </p>
    <p>
      And Big Kennedy, who had a little of his eye on me most of the time, was
      so good as to approve. He applauded my refusal of alcohol and tobacco. And
      he indorsed my determination to be a boxer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A man who can take care of himself with his hands,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;an' who
      never lets whisky fool him or steal his head, can go far in this game of
      politics. An' it's a pretty good game at that, is politics, and can be
      brought to pay like a bank.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It chanced that I met with an adventure which added to my celebration in a
      way I could have wished. I was set upon by a drunken fellow&mdash;a
      stranger. He was an invader, bent upon mischief and came from an adjacent
      and a rival ward. I had offered no provocation; why he selected me to be
      his victim and whether it were accident or design I cannot say. Possibly I
      was pointed out to this drinking Hotspur as one from whose conquest honor
      would flow; perhaps some enemy of the pattern of Sheeny Joe had set him to
      it. All I know is that without challenge given, or the least offer of
      warning, the creature bore down upon me, whirling his fists like flails.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You're the party I'm lookin' for!&rdquo; was all he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the mix-up to follow, and which I had neither time to consider nor
      avoid, the visitor from that other ward was fully and indubitably beaten.
      This was so evident that he himself admitted it when at the finish of
      hostilities certain Samaritans gave him strong drink as a restorative. It
      developed also that my assailant, in a shadowy subdued way, was a kind of
      prizefighter, and by his own tribe deemed invincible. My victory,
      therefore, made a noise in immediate circles; and I should say it saved me
      from a deal of trouble and later strife, since it served to place me in a
      class above the common. There came few so drunk or so bold as to ask for
      trouble with me, and I found that this casual battle&mdash;safe, too,
      because my prizefighter was too drunk to be dangerous&mdash;had brought me
      a wealth of peace.
    </p>
    <p>
      There dawned a day when Big Kennedy gave me a decisive mark of his esteem.
      He presented me to his father. The elder Kennedy, white-haired and
      furrowed of age, was known as &ldquo;Old Mike.&rdquo; He was a personage of gravity
      and power, since his was the only voice in that region to which Big
      Kennedy would yield. Wherefore to be of &ldquo;Old Mike's&rdquo; acquaintance shone in
      one's favor like a title of knighthood.
    </p>
    <p>
      Big Kennedy's presentation speech, when he led me before his father, was
      characteristic and peculiar. Old Mike was in the shadow of his front
      porch, while three or four oldsters of the neighborhood, like a council or
      a little court about a monarch, and all smoking short clay pipes, were
      sitting about him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here's a pup,&rdquo; cried Big Kennedy, with his hand on my shoulder, &ldquo;I want
      you to look over. He's a great pup and ought to make a great dog.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Old Mike glanced at me out of his twinkling gray eyes. After a moment he
      said, addressing me:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come ag'in.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      That was all I had from Old Mike that journey.
    </p>
    <p>
      Big Kennedy it should be said was a model for all sons. He kept his father
      in ease and comfort in a house of his own. He was prone to have Old Mike's
      advice, particularly if what he proposed were a step novel or one
      dangerous in its policy, and he never went to anything in the face of Old
      Mike's word. It wasn't deference, it was faith; Big Kennedy believed in
      the wisdom of Old Mike and relied upon it with a confidence that was
      implicit. I shall have more to tell of Old Mike as my story unrolls to the
      eye. If Big Kennedy were my example, Old Mike should be called my mentor.
      Taking the cue from Big Kennedy, I came to own for Old Mike that
      veneration which the youths of Ancient Greece felt for their oracles, and
      as utterly accepted either his argument or conclusion. It stood no wonder
      that I was impressed and played upon by this honor of an introduction to
      Old Mike. To bring you before Old Mike and name you for his consideration
      was the extremest proof of Big Kennedy's regard. As I've said, it
      glittered on one like the chain and spurs of knighthood, and the fact of
      it gave me a pedestal among my fellows.
    </p>
    <p>
      After my bout with that erring one who came out of his own ward to sup
      grief at my hands, there began to collect about me a coterie of halfway
      bruisers. This circle&mdash;and our enemies were quick to bestow upon it
      the epithet of &ldquo;gang&rdquo;&mdash;never had formal organization. And while the
      members were of the rougher sort, and each a man of his hands, the
      argument of its coming together was not so much aggression as protection.
    </p>
    <p>
      The town forty years ago was not a theater of peace and lambs'-wool
      safety. One's hand must keep one's head, and a stout arm, backed by a
      stout heart, traveled far. To leave one's own ward, or even the
      neighborhood where one lived, was to invite attack. In an alien ward, one
      would be set upon and beaten to rags before one traveled a mile. If one of
      the enemy were not equal to the business, others would lend a hand.
      Whether it required one or two or three or twenty, the interloper was
      fated to heir a drubbing. If his bones were not broken, he was looked upon
      as fortunate, while those who had undertaken to correct his wanderings
      went despised as bunglers who had slighted a task.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now and then a war-party would make a sortie from their own region to
      break windows and heads in the country of an enemy. Such hands often
      descended upon the domain of Big Kennedy, and it was a notion of defense
      against these Goths which brought the militant spirits I have mentioned to
      my shoulder. It was we who must meet them, when they would make desolate
      our territory. The police were of no use; they either walked the other way
      in a spirit of cautious neutrality, or were driven into hiding with a
      shower of stones.
    </p>
    <p>
      By the common tongue, this coterie to collect at my back was named the
      &ldquo;Tin Whistle Gang.&rdquo; Each member carried a whistle as part of his pocket
      furniture. These were made of uniform pattern, and the same keen note,
      like the screech of a hawk, was common to all.
    </p>
    <p>
      The screaming fife-like song would bring out the Tin Whistles as hotly
      bent for action as a colony of wasps. In those days, when might was right,
      the sound of these whistles was a storm signal. Quiet people shut their
      doors and drew their bolts, while apothecaries made ready to sell lint and
      plasters.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is required that I speak of the Tin Whistles in this place. I was now
      for the first time to be called into political activity by Big Kennedy. I
      was eighteen, and of a sober, steady, confident cast, and trustworthy in a
      wordless way. Because I was sober of face and one not given to talk or to
      laughter, men looked on me as five years better than my age; I think these
      characteristics even imposed on Big Kennedy himself, for he dealt with me
      as though I were a man full grown.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was in the height of a campaign. Two days before the balloting, Big
      Kennedy sent for me. There was a room to the rear of his bar. This room
      was a holy of holies; no one entered there who was not established in the
      confidence of Big Kennedy. It was a greater distinction even than the
      acquaintance of Old Mike. Knowing these things, my brow flushed when Big
      Kennedy led me into this sanctum of his policies.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, if I didn't trust you,&rdquo; said Big Kennedy, looking me hard in the
      eye, &ldquo;if I didn't trust you, you'd be t'other side of that door.&rdquo; I said
      nothing; I had found that silence pleased Big Kennedy, and I learned early
      to keep my tongue between my teeth. Big Kennedy went on: &ldquo;On election day
      the polls will close at six o'clock. Half an hour before they close, take
      that Bible Class of yours, the Tin Whistles, and drive every one of the
      opposition workers an' ticket peddlers away from the polling place. You'll
      know them by their badges. I don't want anyone hurt mor'n you have to. The
      less blood, the better. Blood's news; it gets into the papers. Now
      remember: half an hour before six, blow your whistle an' sail in. When
      you've got the other fellows on the run, keep'em goin'. And don't let'em
      come back, d'ye see.&rdquo;

      CHAPTER V&mdash;THE BATTLE OF THE BALLOTS
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">B</span>IG KENNEDY'S
      commands concerning the Tin Whistles taught me that lurking somewhere in
      the election situation he smelled peril to himself. Commonly, while his
      methods might be a wide shot to the left of the lawful, they were never
      violent. He must feel himself hard pressed to call for fist and club. He
      lived at present cross-purposes with sundry high spirits of the general
      organization; perhaps a word was abroad for his disaster and he had heard
      some sigh of it. This would be nothing wonderful; coarse as he seemed
      fibered, Big Kennedy had spun his web throughout the ward as close-meshed
      as any spider, and any fluttering proof of treason was certain to be
      caught in it.
    </p>
    <p>
      The election, while the office at local bay came to be no weightier than
      that of Alderman, was of moment to Big Kennedy. Defeat would mean his
      eclipse, and might even spell his death of politics. To lose the Alderman
      was to let fall the reins of ward direction. The Alderman and his
      turtle-devouring fellows cracked the whip over the police whom they
      appointed or dismissed, and the police were a ballot-engine not to be
      resisted. He who held the Alderman, held the police; and he who had the
      police, carried victory between his hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      Doubtless it was some inner-circle treachery which Big Kennedy
      apprehended. The regular opposition, while numerous and carrying on its
      muster rolls the best respectability of the ward, lacked of that
      organization which was the ridgepole of Big Kennedy's supremacies. It
      straggled, and was mob-like in its movements; and while, as I've written,
      it showed strong in numbers, it was no more to be collected or fashioned
      into any telling force for political effort than a flock of grazing sheep.
      If there were to come nothing before him more formidable than the regular
      opposition, Big Kennedy would go over it like a train of cars and ask no
      aid of shoulder-hitters. Such innocent ones might stand three deep about a
      ballot-box, and yet Big Kennedy would take from it what count of votes he
      chose and they be none the wiser. It would come to no more than cheating a
      child at cards.
    </p>
    <p>
      The open opposition to Big Kennedy was made up of divers misfit elements.
      At its head, as a sort of captain by courtesy, flourished that reputable
      peppery old gentleman who aforetime took my part against Sheeny Joe. A bit
      in love with his own eloquence, and eager for a forum wherein to exercise
      it, the reputable old gentleman had named himself for Alderman against Big
      Kennedy's candidate. As a campaign scheme of vote-getting&mdash;for he
      believed he had but to be heard to convince a listener&mdash;the reputable
      old gentleman engaged himself upon what he termed a house-to-house
      canvass.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was the evening of that day whereon Big Kennedy gave me those orders
      touching the Tin Whistles when the reputable old gentleman paid a visit to
      Old Mike, that Nestor being as usual on his porch and comforting himself
      with a pipe. I chanced to be present at the conversation, although I had
      no word therein; I was much at Old Mike's knee during those callow days,
      having an appetite for his counsel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-evening, sir,&rdquo; said the reputable old gentleman, taking a chair
      which Old Mike's politeness provided, &ldquo;good-evening, sir. My name is
      Morton&mdash;Mr. Morton of the Morton Bank. I live in Lafayette Place.
      Incidentally, I am a candidate for the office of Alderman, and I thought
      I'd take the freedom of a neighbor and a taxpayer and talk with you on
      that topic of general interest.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why then,&rdquo; returned Old Mike, with a cynical grin, &ldquo;I'm th' daddy of Big
      Jawn Kennedy, an' for ye to talk to me would be loike throwin' away your
      toime.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The reputable old gentleman was set aback by the news. Next he took heart
      of grace.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For,&rdquo; he said, turning upon Old Alike a pleasant eye, although just a
      dash of the patronizing showed in the curve of his brow, &ldquo;if I should be
      so fortunate as to explain to you your whole duty of politics, it might
      influence your son. Your son, I understand, listens greatly to your word.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He would be a ba-ad son who didn't moind his own father,&rdquo; returned Old
      Mike. &ldquo;As to me jooty av politics&mdash;it's th' same as every other
      man's. It's the jooty av lookin' out for meself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This open-air selfishness as declared by Old Mike rather served to shock
      the reputable old gentleman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And in politics do you think first of yourself?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not only first, but lasht,&rdquo; replied Old Mike. &ldquo;An' so do you; an' so does
      every man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I cannot understand the narrowness of your view,&rdquo; retorted the reputable
      old gentleman, somewhat austere and distant. &ldquo;You are a respectable man;
      you call yourself a good citizen?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why,&rdquo; responded Old Mike, for the other's remark concluded with a rising
      inflection like a question, &ldquo;I get along with th' p'lice; an' I get along
      with th' priests&mdash;what more should a man say!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you a taxpayer?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have th' house,&rdquo; responded Old Mike, with a smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      The reputable old gentleman considered the other dubiously. Evidently he
      didn't regard Old Mike's one-story cottage as all that might be desired in
      the way of credentials. Still he pushed on.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you given much attention to political economy?&rdquo; This with an erudite
      cough. &ldquo;Have you made politics a study?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;From me cradle,&rdquo; returned Old Mike. &ldquo;Every Irishman does. I knew so much
      about politics before I was twinty-one, th' British Government would have
      transhported me av I'd stayed in Dublin.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should think,&rdquo; said the reputable old gentleman, with a look of one who
      had found something to stand on, &ldquo;that if you ran from tyranny in Ireland,
      you would refuse here to submit to the tyranny of Tammany Hall. If you
      couldn't abide a Queen, how can you now put up with a Boss?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I didn't run from th' Queen, I ran from th' laws,&rdquo; said Old Mike. &ldquo;As for
      the Boss&mdash;everything that succeeds has a Boss. The President's a
      boss; the Pope's a boss; Stewart's a boss in his store down in City Hall
      Park. That's right; everything that succeeds has a boss. Nothing is strong
      enough to stand the mishtakes av more than one man. Ireland would have
      been free th' long cinturies ago if she'd only had a boss.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But do you call it good citizenship,&rdquo; demanded the reputable old
      gentleman, not a trifle nettled by Old Mike's hard-shell philosophy of
      state; &ldquo;do you call it good citizenship to take your orders from a boss?
      You are loyal to Tammany before you are loyal to the City?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shure!&rdquo; returned Old Mike, puffing the puffs of him who is undisturbed.
      &ldquo;Do ye ever pick up a hand in a game av ca-ards?&rdquo; The reputable old
      gentleman seemed properly disgusted. &ldquo;There you be then! City Government
      is but a game; so's all government, Shure, it's as if you an' me were
      playin' a game av ca-ards, this politics; your party is your hand, an'
      Tammany is my hand. In a game of ca-ards, which are ye loyal to, is it
      your hand or the game? Man, it's your hand av coorse! By the same token! I
      am loyal to Tammany Hall.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      That closed the discussion; the reputable old gentleman went his way, and
      one might tell by his face that the question to assail him was whether he
      had been in a verbal encounter with a Bedlamite or an Anarchist. He did
      not recognize me, nor was I sorry. I liked the reputable old gentleman
      because of that other day, and would not have had him discover me in what
      he so plainly felt to be dangerous company.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He's a mighty ignorant man,&rdquo; said Old Mike, pointing after the reputable
      old gentleman with the stem of his pipe. &ldquo;What this country has mosht to
      fear is th' ignorance av th' rich.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It stood perhaps ten of the clock on the morning of election day when, on
      word sent me, I waited on Big Kennedy in his barroom. When he had drawn me
      into his sanctum at the rear, he, as was his custom, came pointedly to the
      purpose.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There's a fight bein' made on me,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;They've put out a lot of
      money on the quiet among my own people, an' think to sneak th' play on
      me.&rdquo; While Big Kennedy talked, his eyes never left mine, and I could feel
      he was searching me for any flickering sign that the enemy had been
      tampering with my fealty. I stared back at him like a statue. &ldquo;An',&rdquo; went
      on Big Kennedy, &ldquo;not to put a feather-edge on it, I thought I'd run you
      over, an' see if they'd been fixin' you. I guess you're all right; you
      look on the level.&rdquo; Then swinging abruptly to the business of the day;
      &ldquo;Have you got your gang ready?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; I nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Remember my orders. Five-thirty is the time. Go for the blokes with
      badges&mdash;th' ticket peddlers. An' mind! don't pound'em, chase'em.
      Unless they stop to slug with you, don't put a hand on'em.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Being thus re-instructed and about to depart, I made bold to ask Big
      Kennedy if there were any danger of his man's defeat. He shook his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not a glimmer,&rdquo; he replied. &ldquo;But we've got to keep movin'. They've put
      out stacks of money. They've settled it to help elect the opposition
      candidate&mdash;this old gent, Morton. They don't care to win; they're
      only out to make me lose. If they could take the Alderman an' the police
      away from me, they would go in next trip an' kill me too dead to skin. But
      it's no go; they can't make th' dock. They've put in their money; but I'll
      show'em a trick that beats money to a standstill.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was as I had surmised; Big Kennedy feared treachery and the underhand
      support of the enemy by men whom he called his friends. For myself, I
      would stand by him. Beg Kennedy was the only captain I knew.
    </p>
    <p>
      To the commands of Big Kennedy, and their execution, I turned with as
      ready a heart as ever sent duck to drink. No impulse to disobey or desert
      so much as crossed my slope of thought. Tammany Hall has ever been
      military in its spirit. Big Kennedy was my superior officer, I but a
      subaltern; it was my province to accept his commands and carry them
      forward without argument or pause.
    </p>
    <p>
      In full and proper season, I had my Tin Whistles in hand. I did not march
      them to the polling place in a body, since I was not one to obstreperously
      vaunt or flaunt an enterprise in advance. Also, I was too much the
      instinctive soldier to disclose either my force or my purpose, and I knew
      the value of surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      There were a round twenty of my Tin Whistles, each a shoulder-hitter and
      warm to shine in the graces of Big Kennedy. I might have recruited a
      double strength, but there was no need. I had counted the foe; the
      poll-tenders of the opposition numbered but ten; my twenty, and each a
      berserk of his fists, ought to scatter them like a flock of sparrows. My
      instructions given to my fellows were precisely Big Kennedy's orders as
      given to me; no blows, no blood unless made necessary by resistance.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the time drew down for action, my Tin Whistles were scattered about,
      sticking close to the elbows of the enemy, and waiting the signal. The
      polling booth was a small frame construction, not much larger than a
      Saratoga trunk. On other occasions it served as the office of a wood and
      coal concern. The table, with the ballot-box thereon, stood squarely in
      the door; behind it were the five or six officers&mdash;judges and tally
      clerks&mdash;of election. There was a crush and crowd of Big Kennedy's
      clansmen to entirely surround the little building, and they so choked up
      the path that ones who had still to vote couldn't push through. There
      arose, too, a deal of shoving and jostling, and all to a running uproar of
      profanity; affairs appeared to be drifting towards the disorderly.
    </p>
    <p>
      The reputable old gentleman, his face red with indignation, was moving to
      and fro on the outskirts of the crowd, looking for a police officer. He
      would have him cut a way through the press for those who still owned
      votes. No officer was visible; the reputable old gentleman, even though he
      searched with that zeal common of candidates anxious for success, would
      have no aid from the constabulary.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And this is the protection,&rdquo; cried the reputable old gentleman, striding
      up to Big Kennedy, and shaking a wrathful finger in his face, &ldquo;that
      citizens and taxpayers receive from the authorities! Here are scores of
      voters who are being blocked from the polls and robbed of their franchise.
      It's an outrage!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Big Kennedy smiled upon the reputable old gentleman, but made no other
      reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's an outrage!&rdquo; repeated the reputable old gentleman in a towering
      fury. &ldquo;Do you hear? It's an outrage on the taxpaying citizens of this
      town!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look out, old man!&rdquo; observed a young fellow who stood at Big Kennedy's
      side, and who from his blackened hands and greasy blue shirt seemed to be
      the engineer of some tug. &ldquo;Don't get too hot. You'll blow a cylinder
      head.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How dare you!&rdquo; fumed the reputable old gentleman; &ldquo;you, a mere boy by
      comparison! how dare you address me in such terms! I'm old enough, sir, to
      be your father! You should understand, sir, that I've voted for a
      president eight times in my life.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's nothin',&rdquo; returned the other gayly; &ldquo;I have voted for a president
      eighty times before ten o'clock.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In the midst of the laugh that followed this piece of characteristic wit,
      Big Kennedy crossed to where I stood.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Send your boys along!&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;Let's see how good you are.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      My whistle screamed the signal. At the first sharp note, a cry went up:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Tin Whistles! The Tin Whistles!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was done in a moment; a pair to a man, my Tin Whistles were sending
      their quarry down the streets as fast as feet might follow. And they
      obeyed directions; not a blow was struck, no blood was drawn; there was a
      hustling flurry, and the others took to their heels. The hard repute of
      the Tin Whistles was such that no ten were wild enough to face them or
      meet their charge.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the Tin Whistles fell upon their victims, the press of men that surged
      about the polling place began to shout, and strain, and tug. Suddenly, the
      small building commenced to heave and lift suspiciously. It was as though
      an earthquake were busy at its base. The mob about the structure seemed to
      be rolling it over on its side. That would be no feat, with men enough to
      set hand upon it and carry it off like a parcel.
    </p>
    <p>
      With the first heave there came shouts and oaths from those within. Then
      arose a crashing of glass, and the table was cast aside, as the threatened
      clerks and judges fought to escape through door and window. In the rush
      and scamper of it, a sharp hand seized the ballot-box.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ten minutes the riot raged. It was calmed by Big Kennedy, who forced
      himself into the middle of the tumult, hurling men right and left with his
      powerful hands as though they were sacks of bran, while he commanded the
      peace in a voice like the roar of a lion.
    </p>
    <p>
      Peace fell; the little building, which had not been overthrown, but only
      rocked and tipped, settled again to a decorous safe solidity; the judges
      and the clerks returned; the restored ballot-box again occupied the table.
    </p>
    <p>
      As that active one, who had saved the ballot-box when the downfall of the
      building seemed threatened came edgewise through the throng, he passed
      close to Big Kennedy. The latter gave him a sharp glance of inquiry.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I stuffed it full to the cover,&rdquo; whispered the active one. &ldquo;We win four
      to one, an' you can put down your money on that!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Big Kennedy nodded, and the zealot who saved the ballot-box passed on and
      disappeared.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the Tin Whistles fell upon their prey, I started to go with them. But
      in a moment I saw there was no call; the foe went off at top flight, and
      my twenty would keep them moving. Thus reasoning, I turned again to see
      what was going forward about the booth.
    </p>
    <p>
      My interest was immediately engaged by the words and actions of the
      reputable old gentleman, who, driven to frenzy, was denouncing. Big
      Kennedy and all who wore his colors as scoundrels without measure or mate.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I defy both you and your plug-uglies,&rdquo; he was shouting, flourishing his
      fist in the face of Big Kennedy, who, busy with his own plans, did not
      heed him. &ldquo;This is a plot to stuff the ballot-box.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The reputable old gentleman had gone thus far, when a hulking creature of
      a rough struck him from behind with a sandbag. I sprang forward, and
      fended away a second blow with my left arm. As I did so, I struck the
      rough on the jaw with such vengeful force that, not only did he drop like
      some pole-axed ox, but my right hand was fairly wrecked thereby. Without
      pausing to discover my own condition or that of the sandbag-wielding
      ruffian, I picked up the reputable old gentleman and bore him out of the
      crowd.
    </p>
    <p>
      The reputable old gentleman had come by no serious harm; he was stunned a
      trifle, and his hat broken. With me to hold him up, he could stand on his
      feet, though still dazed and addled from the dull power of the blow. I
      beckoned a carriage which Big Kennedy had employed to bring the old and
      infirm to the polling place. It came at my signal, and I placed the
      reputable old gentleman inside, and told the driver to take him to his
      home. The reputable old gentleman was murmuring and shaking his head as he
      drove away. As I closed the carriage door, he muttered: &ldquo;This is
      barbarous! That citizens and taxpayers should receive such treatment&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
       The balance was lost in the gride of the wheels.
    </p>
    <p>
      The hurly-burly had now ceased; all was as calm and equal as a goose pond.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So you saved the old gentleman,&rdquo; said Big Kennedy, as he came towards me.
      &ldquo;Gratitude, I s'pose, because he stood pal to you ag'inst Sheeny Joe that
      time. Gratitude! You'll get over that in time,&rdquo; and Big Kennedy wore a
      pitying look as one who dwells upon another's weakness. &ldquo;That was Jimmy
      the Blacksmith you smashed. You'd better look out for him after this.&rdquo; My
      dander was still on end, and I intimated a readiness to look out for Jimmy
      the Blacksmith at once.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mind your back now!&rdquo; cautioned Big Kennedy, &ldquo;and don't take to gettin' it
      up. Let things go as they lay. Never fight till you have to, d'ye see! an'
      never fight for fun. Don't go lookin' for th' Blacksmith until you hear
      he's out lookin' for you.&rdquo; Then, as shifting the subject: &ldquo;It's been a
      great day, an' everything to run off as smooth an' true as sayin' mass.
      Now let's go back and watch'em count the votes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did we beat them?&rdquo; I asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Snowed'em under!&rdquo; said Big Kennedy.

      CHAPTER VI&mdash;THE RED JACKET ASSOCIATION
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">B</span>IG KENNEDY'S
      success at the election served to tighten the rivets of his rule. It was
      now I looked to see him ferret forth and punish those renegades who had
      wrought against him in the dark. To my amazement he engaged himself in no
      such retaliatory labor. On the contrary he smiled on all about him like
      the sun at noon. Was it folly or want of heart that tied his hands?
      Assuredly it was error, and this I submitted to Old Mike. That veteran of
      policy disagreed with this, meanwhile beaming upon me in a way of fatherly
      cunning.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jawn knows his business,&rdquo; said Old Mike. &ldquo;Thim people didn't rebel, they
      sold out. That's over with an' gone by. Everybody'll sell ye out if he
      gets enough; that's a rishk ye have to take. There's that Limerick man,
      Gaffney, however; ye'll see something happen to Gaffney. He's one of thim
      patent-leather Micks an' puts on airs. He's schemin' to tur-rn Jawn down
      an' take th' wa-ard. Ye'll see something happen to that Limerick man,
      Gaffney.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Gaffney made his money with flour and horse feed and hay and similar
      goods. Also, as Old Mike said, Gaffney was ambitious. It was within the
      week, when a midnight shower of stones smashed sash and glass and laid
      waste that offensive merchant's place of business. Gaffney restored his
      sash and glass only to invite a second midnight storm of stones. Three
      times were Gaffney's windows smashed by hands unknown; and no police
      officer would go within two blocks of Gaffney's. In the end, Gaffney came
      to Big Kennedy. The latter met him with a hectoring laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why do you come to me?&rdquo; asked Big Kennedy. &ldquo;Somebody's been trying to
      smash the windows of my leadership for over a year, but I never went
      howling about it to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Gaffney showed not a little shaken. He asked, in a manner sullen yet
      beaten, what he should do.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'd get out of th' ward,&rdquo; replied Big Kennedy as cool as ice. &ldquo;Somebody's
      got it in for you. Now a man that'll throw a brick will light a match,
      d'ye see, an' a feed store would burn like a tar barrel.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I could sell out, I'd quit,&rdquo; said Gaffney.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; responded Big Kennedy, &ldquo;I always like to help a friend.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Grocer Fogel bought Gaffney's store, making a bargain.
    </p>
    <p>
      This iron-bound lesson in practical politics I dwell on in full. I drew
      from it some notion of the stern character of that science. Old Mike, from
      the pinnacles of his hard experience, looked down to justify it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gaffney would do th' same,&rdquo; said Old Mike, &ldquo;if his ar-rm was long enough.
      Politics is a game where losers lose all; it's like war, shure, only no
      one's kilt&mdash;at any rate, not so many.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As the days drew on, I grew in favor with Big Kennedy, and the blossom
      thereof took this color.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why don't you start a club?&rdquo; he asked one afternoon, as we sat in his
      sanctum. &ldquo;You could bring two hundred young fellows together, couldn't
      you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; I replied. I spoke doubtfully; the suggestion was of the sharpest,
      and gave me no space to think. It was one, too, which asked questions of
      the kind that don't answer themselves. &ldquo;But where would they meet?&rdquo; I put
      this after a pause.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There's the big lodgeroom over my saloon,&rdquo; and Big Kennedy tossed his
      stubby thumb towards the ceiling. &ldquo;You could meet there. There's a dumb
      waiter from the bar to send up beer and smokes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How about the Tin Whistles?&rdquo; I hinted. &ldquo;Would they do to build on?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Leave the Tin Whistles out. They're all right as shoulder-hitters, an' a
      swifter gang to help at the polls, or break up the opposition's meetin's,
      never walked the streets. But for a play of this kind, they're a little
      off color. Your Tin Whistles can join, man by man, but if they do they
      must sing low. They mustn't try to give the show; it's the back seat for
      them. What you're out for now is the respectable young workin'-man racket;
      that's the lay.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But where's the money?&rdquo; said I. &ldquo;These people I have in mind haven't much
      money.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course not,&rdquo; retorted Big Kennedy confidently, &ldquo;an' what little they
      have they want for beer. But listen: You get the room free. Then once a
      year your club gives an excursion on the river; it ought to sell hundreds
      of tickets because there'll be hundreds of officeholders, an' breweries,
      an' saloon keepers, an' that sort who'll be crazy to buy'em. If they aint
      crazy to start with, you ought to be able to make'em crazy th' first
      election that comes 'round. The excursion should bring three thousand
      dollars over an' above expenses, d'ye see. Then you can give balls in the
      winter an' sell tickets. Then there's subscriptions an' hon'ry
      memberships. You'll ketch on; there's lots of ways to skin th' cat. You
      can keep th' club in clover an' have some of the long green left. That's
      settled then; you organize a young men's club. You be president an'
      treasurer; see to that. An' now,&rdquo; here Big Kennedy took me by the shoulder
      and looked me instructively in the eye, &ldquo;it's time for you to be clinchin'
      onto some stuff for yourself. This club's goin' to take a lot of your
      time. It'll make you do plenty of work. You're no treetoad; you can't live
      on air an' scenery.&rdquo; Big Kennedy's look deepened, and he shook me as one
      who demands attention. &ldquo;You'll be president and treasurer, particularly
      treasurer; and I'll chip you in this piece of advice. A good cook always
      licks his fingers.&rdquo; Here he winked deeply.
    </p>
    <p>
      This long speech was not thrown away. Big Kennedy, having delivered
      himself, lapsed into silence, while I sat ruminating ways and means and
      what initiatory steps I should take.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What shall we call it?&rdquo; I asked, as I arose to go.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Give it an Indian name,&rdquo; said Big Kennedy. &ldquo;S'p-pose you call it the Red
      Jacket Association.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Within the fortnight the Red Jackets held their maiden meeting. It was an
      hour rife of jubilation, fellowship, and cheer. While abstinence from
      drink was my guiding phrase, I made no point of that kind in the conduct
      of others, and a nearby brewery having contributed unlimited beer those
      whom it pleased lacked no reason for a light heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      As Big Kennedy had advised, I was chosen for the double responsibilities
      of president and treasurer. I may say in my own compliment, however, that
      these honors came drifting to my feet. There were reasons for this aside
      from any stiffness of heart or fist-virtues which might be mine. I have
      said that I was by disposition as taciturn as a tree, and this wondrous
      gift of silence earned me the name of wisdom, I was looked upon as one
      whose depth was rival to the ocean's. Stronger still, as the argument by
      which I rose, was my sobriety. The man who drinks, and whether it be
      little or much, never fails to save his great respect for him who sets
      whisky aside.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An' now,&rdquo; remarked Big Kennedy, when the club had found fortunate birth,
      &ldquo;with these Red Jackets to make the decent front, th' Tin Whistles to fall
      back on for the rough work, and Gaffney out of th' way, I call th' ward
      cleaned up. I'll tell you this, my son: after th' next election you shall
      have an office, or there's no such man as Big John Kennedy.&rdquo; He smote the
      table with his heavy hand until the glasses danced.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I won't be of age,&rdquo; I suggested.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What's the difference?&rdquo; said Big Kennedy. &ldquo;We'll play that you are, d'ye
      see. There'll be no one fool enough to talk about your age if I'm at your
      side. We'll make it a place in the dock department; that'll be about your
      size. S'ppose we say a perch where there's twelve hundred dollars a year,
      an' nothin' to do but draw th' scads an' help your friends.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jimmy the Blacksmith was an under-captain of Big Kennedy's and prevailed
      as vote-master in the northern end of the ward. Within certain fixed
      frontiers, which ran on one side within a block of my home, it was the
      business of Jimmy the Blacksmith to have watch and ward. He had charge of
      what meetings were held, and under the thumb of Big Kennedy carried
      forward the campaign, and on election day got out the vote.
    </p>
    <p>
      Having given the question its share of thought, I determined for myself on
      a forward, upward step. My determination&mdash;heart and soul&mdash;became
      agate-hard to drive Jimmy the Blacksmith from his place, and set up my own
      rule over that slender kingdom.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nor would I say aught to Big Kennedy of this private war which I
      meditated. Not that he would have interfered either to thwart or aid me,
      but by the ethics of the situation, to give him such notice was neither
      proper nor expected. To fight Jimmy the Blacksmith for his crown was not
      only right by every rule of ward justice, but it was the thing encouraged
      as a plan best likely to bring the strongest to the fore. Take what you
      may, keep what you can! was a Tammany statute; I would be right enough in
      that overthrow of Jimmy the Blacksmith, I was bent upon, if only I proved
      strong enough to bring it about. No, I was not to give word of my campaign
      to Big Kennedy, it was none of his affair, and he would prefer to be
      ignorant since he was bound to stand neutral. It is policy thus to let the
      younger cocks try beak and spur among themselves; it develops leadership,
      and is the one sure way of safety in picking out your captains.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was one drawback; I didn't live within the region of which I would
      make prize. However, ambition edged my wits and I bethought me of a plan
      whereby I might plow around that stump.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was my own good fortune that I had no love, but only hate, for Jimmy
      the Blacksmith. I was yet so softened of a want of years, that had we been
      friends I would have withheld myself from attacking him. Youth is
      generous, wherefore youth is weak. It is not until age has stopped these
      leaks in one's nature, and one ceases to give and only lives to take and
      keep, that one's estate begins to take on fat. Have the word, therefore,
      of him whose scars speak for his experience: that one will be wise who
      regards generosity as a malady, a mere disease, and sets to cure it with
      every sullen, cruel drug the case demands. I say it was my good luck to
      hate Jimmy the Blacksmith. He had never condoned that election-day blow,
      and I must confess there was reason for this hardness. His jaw had been
      broken, and, though mended, it was still all of one side and made of him a
      most forbidding spectacle. And he nursed a thought of revenge in his
      breast; there came a light to his eye when we met that belongs with none
      save him whose merest wish is murder. I would have had more than black
      looks, but his heart was of a pale and treacherous family that can strike
      no blow in front, and thus far the pathway of chance had not opened for
      him to come upon me unaware. For all of which, not alone my ambition, but
      my safety and my pleasure urged me about the destruction of Jimmy the
      Blacksmith.
    </p>
    <p>
      That epithet of the Blacksmith was born of no labors of the forge. Jimmy
      the Blacksmith was no more a blacksmith than a bishop. If he ever did a
      day's work, then the fact was already so far astern upon the tides of time
      that no eye of memory might discern it. The title was won in a brawl
      wherein he slew a man. True to his nature, Jimmy slunk away from his
      adversary and would not face him. He returned, carrying a blacksmith's
      fore-hammer. Creeping behind the other, Jimmy suddenly cried, with an
      oath:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll clink your anvil for you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With that word, the hammer descended and the victim fell, skull crushed
      like an eggshell. It required a deal of perjury to save the murderer from
      noose and trap. I should not say he was set backward by this bloodshed,
      since most men feared him for it and stepped out of his way, giving him
      what he asked for in the name of their own safety. It was for this work he
      was called the Blacksmith, and he carried the word as though it were a
      decoration.
    </p>
    <p>
      Such was the man on whose downfall I stood resolved and whose place I
      meant to make my own. The thing was simple of performance too; all it
      asked were secrecy and a little wit. There was a Tammany club, one of
      regular sort and not like my Red Jacket Association, which was volunteer
      in its character. It met in that kingdom of the Blacksmith's as a little
      parliament of politics. This club was privileged each year to name for Big
      Kennedy's approval a man for that post of undercaptain. The annual
      selection was at hand. For four years the club had named Jimmy the
      Blacksmith; there came never the hint for believing he would not be
      pitched upon again.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now be it known that scores of my Red Jackets were residents of the
      district over which Jimmy the Blacksmith held sway. Some there were who
      already belonged to his club. I gave those others word to join at once.
      Also I told them, as they regarded their standing as Red Jackets, to be
      present at that annual meeting.
    </p>
    <p>
      The night arrived; the room was small and the attendance&mdash;except for
      my Red Jackets&mdash;being sparse, my people counted for three-quarters of
      those present. With the earliest move I took possession of the meeting,
      and selected its chairman. Then, by resolution, I added the block in which
      I resided to the public domain of the club. That question of residence
      replied to, instead of Jimmy the Blacksmith, I was named ballot-captain
      for the year. It was no more complex as a transaction than counting ten.
      The fact was accomplished like scratching a match; I had set the foot of
      my climbing on Jimmy the Blacksmith's neck.
    </p>
    <p>
      That unworthy was present; and to say he was made mad with the fury of it
      would be to write with snow the color of his feelings.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's a steal!&rdquo; he cried, springing to his feet. The little bandbox of a
      hall rang with his roarings. Then, to me: &ldquo;I'll fight you for it! You
      don't dare meet me in the Peach Orchard to-morrow at three!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bring your sledge, Jimmy,&rdquo; shouted some humorist; &ldquo;you'll need it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Peach Orchard might have been a peach orchard in the days of Peter
      Stuyvesant. All formal battles took place in the Peach Orchard. Wherefore,
      and because the challenge for its propriety was not without precedent, to
      the Peach Orchard at the hour named I repaired.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jimmy the Blacksmith, however, came not. Someone brought the word that he
      was sick; whereat those present, being fifty gentlemen with a curiosity to
      look on carnage, and ones whose own robust health led them to regard the
      term &ldquo;sickness&rdquo; as a synonym for the preposterous, jeered the name of
      Jimmy the Blacksmith from their hearts.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jimmy the Cur! it ought to be,&rdquo; growled one, whose disappointment over a
      fight deferred was sore in the extreme.
    </p>
    <p>
      Perhaps you will argue that it smacked of the underhand to thus steal upon
      Jimmy the Blacksmith and take his place from him without due warning
      given. I confess it would have been more like chivalry if I had sent him,
      so to say, a glove and told my intentions against him. Also it would have
      augmented labor and multiplied risk. The great thing is to win and win
      cheaply; a victory that costs more than it comes to is nothing but a mask
      for defeat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You're down and out,&rdquo; said Big Kennedy, when Jimmy the Blacksmith brought
      his injuries to that chieftain. &ldquo;Your reputation is gone too; you were a
      fool to say 'Peach Orchard' when you lacked the nerve to make it good.
      You'll never hold up your head ag'in in th' ward, an' if I was you I'd
      line out after Gaffney. This is a bad ward for a mongrel, Jimmy, an' I'd
      skin out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jimmy the Blacksmith followed Gaffney and disappeared from the country of
      Big Kennedy. He was to occur again in my career, however, as he who reads
      on shall see, and under conditions which struck the color from my cheek
      and set my heart to a trot with the terrors they loosed at its heels.

      CHAPTER VII&mdash;HOW THE BOSS WAS NAMED FOR ALDERMAN
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">N</span>OW it was that in
      secret my ambition took a hearty start and would vine-like creep and
      clamber. My triumph over Jimmy the Blacksmith added vastly to my stature
      of politics. Moreover, the sly intrigue by which I conquered began to
      found for me a fame. I had been locally illustrious, if I may so set the
      term to work, for a granite fist and a courage as rooted as a tree. For
      these traits the roughs revered me, and I may say I found my uses and
      rewards. Following my conquest of that under-captaincy, however, certain
      upper circles began to take account of me; circles which, if no purer than
      those others of ruder feather, were wont to produce more bulging profits
      in the pockets of their membership. In brief, I came to be known for one
      capable and cunning of a plot, and who was not without a genius for the
      executive.
    </p>
    <p>
      With Big Kennedy I took high position. His relations with Jimmy the
      Blacksmith never had been close; he had never unbuckled in any friendship
      and felt for him nothing nearer than distrust. But for me he held another
      pose. Big Kennedy, upon my elevation, fair made me his partner in the
      ward, a partnership wherein, to speak commercially, I might be said to
      have had an interest of one-fourth. This promotion brought me pleasure;
      and being only a boy when all was said, while I went outwardly quiet, my
      spirit in the privacy of my own bosom would on occasion spread moderately
      its tail and strut.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, as time passed, I became like the shadow of Big Kennedy's authority
      throughout the ward; my voice was listened to and my word obeyed. I should
      say, too, that I made it a first concern to carry the interest of Big
      Kennedy ever on the crest of my thought. This should be called the
      offspring neither of loyalty nor gratitude; I did it because it was
      demanded of my safety and to curry advantage for myself. For all that
      attitude of confident friendship, I was not put off my guard. Big Kennedy
      never let my conduct roam beyond his ken. A first sign of an interest
      outside his own would have meant my instant disappearance. He would have
      plucked me of my last plume. With a breath he could reduce me to be a
      beggarman where now I gave alms. Having, therefore, the measure of his
      fell abilities, I was not so blind as to draw their horns my way.
    </p>
    <p>
      Still, while I went tamely to heel at a word from Big Kennedy, I had also
      resolved to advance. I meant before all was over to mount the last summit
      of Tammany Hall. I laid out my life as architects lay out a building; it
      would call for years, but I had years to give.
    </p>
    <p>
      My work with Grocer Fogel had ended long ago. I now gave myself entirely
      to the party, and to deepen the foundations of its power. Inside our lines
      a mighty harmony prevailed. Big Kennedy and those headquarters enemies who
      once schemed for his defeat had healed their differences and the surface
      of events showed as serene as summer seas. About this time a great star
      was rising in the Tammany sky; a new chief was gaining evolution. Already,
      his name was first, and although he cloaked his dictatorship with
      prudence, the sophisticated knew how his will was even then as law and
      through his convenient glove of velvet felt his grip of steel.
    </p>
    <p>
      For myself, I closely observed the unfolding of his genius. His methods as
      well as those of Big Kennedy were now my daily lesson. I had ever before
      me in that formative, plastic hour the examples of these past-masters of
      the art of domination.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was well for me. A dictator is so much unlike a poet that he is made,
      not born. He must build himself; and when completed he must save himself
      from being torn to pieces. No one blunders into a dictatorship; one might
      as well look to blunder upon some mountain peak. Even blunders are
      amenable to natural law, and it can be taken as a truism that no one
      blunders up hill.
    </p>
    <p>
      Wherefore, he who would be dictator and with his touch determine the day
      for pushing, struggling, rebelling thousands and mold their times for
      them, must study. And study hard I did.
    </p>
    <p>
      My Red Jackets received my most jealous care. They deserved that much from
      me, since their existence offered measurably for my support. When the day
      arrived, I was given that twelve-hundred-dollar place with the docks,
      whereof Big Kennedy had spoken, and under his suggestion and to the limits
      of my strength made what employ of it I might for my own and my friends'
      behoof. But those twelve hundred dollars would not go far in the affairs
      of one who must for their franchises lead hither and yon divers scores of
      folk, all of whom had but the one notion of politics, that it was founded
      of free beer. There came, too, a procession of borrowers, and it was a
      dull day when, in sums from a dime to a dollar, I did not to these clients
      part with an aggregate that would have supported any family for any decent
      week. There existed no door of escape; these charges, and others of
      similar kidney, must be met and borne; it was the only way to keep one's
      hold of politics; and so Old Mike would tell me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But it's better,&rdquo; said that deep one, &ldquo;to lind people money than give it
      to'em. You kape thim bechune your finger longer by lindin'.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was on the Red Jackets I leaned most for personal revenue. They were my
      bread-winners. No Tammany organization, great or small, keeps books. No
      man may say what is received, or what is disbursed, or name him who gave
      or got; and that is as it should be. If it were otherwise, one's troubles
      would never earn an end. For the Red Jackets I was&mdash;to steal a title
      from the general organization&mdash;not alone the treasurer, but the
      wiskinskie. In this latter rôle I collected the money that came in. Thus
      the interests, financial, of the Red Jackets were wholly within my hands,
      and recalling what Big Kennedy had said anent a good cook, I failed not to
      lick my fingers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Money was in no wise difficult to get. The Red Jackets were formidable
      both for numbers and influence, and their favor or resentment meant a
      round one thousand votes. Besides, there stood the memorable Tin Whistles,
      reckless, militant, ready for any midnight thing, and their dim outlines,
      like a challenge or a threat, filled up the cloudy background. Those with
      hopes or fears of office, and others who as merchants or saloonkeepers, or
      who gambled, or did worse, to say naught of builders who found the streets
      and pavements a convenient even though an illegal resting place for their
      materials of bricks and lime and lumber, never failed of response to a
      suggestion that the good Red Jackets stood in need of help. Every man of
      these contributing gentry, at their trades of dollar-getting, was
      violating law or ordinance, and I who had the police at my beck could
      instantly contract their liberties to a point that pinched. When such were
      the conditions, anyone with an imagination above a shoemaker's will see
      that to produce what funds my wants demanded would be the lightest of
      tasks. It was like grinding sugar canes, and as easily sure of steady
      sweet returns.
    </p>
    <p>
      True, as an exception to a rule, one met now and again with him who for
      some native bull-necked obstinacy would refuse a contribution. In such
      event the secret of his frugality was certain to leak forth and spread
      itself among my followers. It would not be required that one offer even a
      hint. Soon as ever the tale of that parsimony reached the ear of a Tin
      Whistle, disasters like a flock of buzzards collected about the saving
      man. His windows were darkly broken like Gaffney's. Or if he were a grocer
      his wares would upset themselves about the pavements, his carts of
      delivery break down, his harnesses part and fall in pieces, and he beset
      to dine off sorrow in many a different dish.
    </p>
    <p>
      And then and always there were the police to call his violative eye to
      this ordinance, or hale him before a magistrate for that one. And there
      were Health Boards, and Street Departments, who at a wink of Red Jacket
      disfavor would descend upon a recalcitrant and provide burdens for his
      life. With twenty methods of compulsion against him, and each according to
      law, there arose no man strong enough to refuse those duties of donation.
      He must support the fortunes of my Red Jackets or see his own decline, and
      no one with a heart for commerce was long to learn the lesson.
    </p>
    <p>
      The great credit, however, in such coils was due the police. With them to
      be his allies, one might not only finance his policies, but control and
      count a vote; and no such name as failure.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They're the foot-stones of politics,&rdquo; said Old Mike. &ldquo;Kape th' p'lice,
      an' you kape yourself on top.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Nor was this the task complex. It was but to threaten them with the powers
      above on the one hand, or on the other toss them individually an
      occasional small bone of profit to gnaw, and they would stand to you like
      dogs. I soon had these ins and outs of money-getting at the tips of my
      tongue and my fingers, for I went to school to Big Kennedy and Old Mike in
      the accomplishment, and I may tell you it was a branch of learning they
      were qualified to teach.
    </p>
    <p>
      Blackmail! cry you? Now there goes a word to that. These folk were
      violating the law. What would you have?&mdash;their arrest? Let me inform
      you that were the laws of the State and the town enforced to syllable and
      letter, it would drive into banishment one-half the population. They would
      do business at a loss; it would put up the shutters for over half the
      town. Wherefore, it would be against the common interest to arrest them.
    </p>
    <p>
      And still you would have the law enforced? And if it were, what, let me
      ask, would be the immediate response? These delinquents would be fined.
      You would then be satisfied. What should be the corrective difference
      between a fine paid to a court, and a donation paid to my Red Jackets? The
      corrective influence in both should be the same, since in either instance
      it is but a taking of dollars from the purses of the lawless. And yet, you
      clamor, &ldquo;One is blackmail and the other is justice!&rdquo; The separation I
      should say was academic rather than practical; and as for a name: why
      then, I care nothing for a name.
    </p>
    <p>
      I will, however, go this farther journey for my own defense. I have not
      been for over twoscore years with Tammany and sixteen years its head,
      without being driven to some intimate knowledge of my times, and those
      principles of individual as well as communal action which underlie them to
      make a motive. And now I say, that I have yet to meet that man, or that
      corporation, and though the latter were a church, who wouldn't follow
      interest across a prostrate law, and in the chase of dollars break through
      ordinance and statute as a cow walks through a cobweb. And each and all
      they come most willingly to pay the prices of their outlawry, and
      receivers are as bad as thieves&mdash;your price-payer as black as your
      price-taker. Practically, the New York definition of an honest man has
      ever gone that he is one who denounces any robbery in the proceeds whereof
      he is not personally interested, and with that definition my life has
      never failed to comply. If Tammany and Tammany men have been guilty of
      receiving money from violators of law, they had among their accomplices
      the town's most reputable names and influences. Why then should you pursue
      the one while you excuse the other? And are you not, when you do so, quite
      as much the criminal as either?
    </p>
    <p>
      When I was in the first year of my majority we went into a campaign for
      the ownership of the town. Standing on the threshold of my earliest vote,
      I was strung like a bow to win. My fervor might have gained a more than
      common heat, because by decision of Big Kennedy I, myself, was put down to
      make the run for alderman. There was a world of money against us, since we
      had the respectable element, which means ever the rich, to be our enemies.
    </p>
    <p>
      Big Kennedy and I, after a session in his sanctum, resolved that not one
      meeting should be held by our opponents within our boundaries. It was not
      that we feared for the vote; rather it swung on a point of pride; and then
      it would hearten our tribesmen should we suppress the least signal of the
      enemy's campaign.
    </p>
    <p>
      Having limitless money, the foe decided for sundry gatherings. They also
      outlined processions, hired music by the band, and bought beer by the
      barrel. They would have their speakers to address the commons in halls and
      from trucks.
    </p>
    <p>
      On each attempt they were encountered and dispersed. More than once the
      Red Jackets, backed by the faithful Tin Whistles, took possession of a
      meeting, put up their own orators and adopted their own resolutions. If
      the police were called, they invariably arrested our enemies, being
      sapient of their own safety and equal to the work of locating the butter
      on their personal bread. If the enemy through their henchmen or managers
      made physical resistance, the Tin Whistles put them outside the hall, and
      whether through door or window came to be no mighty matter.
    </p>
    <p>
      At times the Red Jackets and their reserves of Tin Whistles would permit
      the opposition to open a meeting. When the first orator had been eloquent
      for perhaps five minutes, a phalanx of Tin Whistles would arise in their
      places, and a hailstorm of sponges, soaking wet and each the size of one's
      head, would descend upon the rostrum. It was a never-failing remedy; there
      lived never chairman nor orator who would face that fusillade. Sometimes
      the lights were turned out; and again, when it was an open-air meeting and
      the speakers to talk from a truck, a bunch of crackers would be exploded
      under the horses and a runaway occur. That simple device was sure to cut
      the meeting short by carrying off the orators. The foe arranged but one
      procession; that was disposed of on the fringe of our territory by an
      unerring, even if improper, volley of eggs and vegetables and similar
      trumpery. The artillery used would have beaten back a charge by cavalry.
    </p>
    <p>
      Still the enemy had the money, and on that important point could overpower
      us like ten for one, and did. Here and there went their agents, sowing sly
      riches in the hope of a harvest of votes. To counteract this still-hunt
      where the argument was cash, I sent the word abroad that our people were
      to take the money and promise votes. Then they were to break the promise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bunco the foe!&rdquo; was the watchword; &ldquo;take their money and 'con' them!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This instruction was deemed necessary for our safety. I educated our men
      to the thought that the more money they got by these methods, the higher
      they would stand with Big Kennedy and me. If it were not for this,
      hundreds would have taken a price, and then, afraid to come back to us,
      might have gone with the banners of the enemy for that campaign at least.
      Now they would get what they could, and wear it for a feather in their
      caps. They exulted in such enterprise; it was spoiling the Egyptian;
      having filled their pockets they would return and make a brag of the fact.
      By these schemes we kept our strength. The enemy parted with money by the
      thousands, yet never the vote did they obtain. The goods failed of
      delivery.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sheeny Joe was a handy man to Big Kennedy. He owned no rank; but voluble,
      active, well dressed, and ready with his money across a barroom counter,
      he grew to have a value. Not once in those years which fell in between our
      encounter on the dock and this time I have in memory, did Sheeny Joe
      express aught save friendship for me. His nose was queer of contour as the
      result of my handiwork, but he met the blemish in a spirit of philosophy
      and displayed no rancors against me as the author thereof. On the
      contrary, he was friendly to the verge of fulsome.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sheeny Joe sold himself to the opposition, hoof and hide and horn. Nor was
      this a mock disposal of himself, although he gave Big Kennedy and myself
      to suppose he still held by us in his heart. No, it wasn't the money that
      changed him; rather I should say that for all his pretenses, his
      hankerings of revenge against me had never slept. It was now he believed
      his day to compass it had come. The business was no more no less than a
      sheer bald plot to take my life, with Sheeny Joe to lie behind it&mdash;the
      bug of evil under the dark chip.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was in the early evening at my own home. Sheeny Joe came and called me
      to the door, and all in a hustle of hurry.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Big Kennedy wants you to come at once to the Tub of Blood,&rdquo; said Sheeny
      Joe.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Tub of Blood was a hang-out for certain bludgeon-wielding thugs who
      lived by the coarser crimes of burglary and highway robbery. It was
      suspected by Big Kennedy and myself as a camping spot for &ldquo;repeaters&rdquo; whom
      the enemy had been at pains to import against us. We had it then in plan
      to set the Tin Whistles to the sacking of it three days before the vote.
    </p>
    <p>
      On this word from Sheeny Joe, and thinking that some new programme was
      afoot, I set forth for the Tub of Blood. As I came through the door, a
      murderous creature known as Strong-Arm Dan was busy polishing glasses
      behind the bar. He looked up, and giving a nod toward a door in the rear,
      said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They want you inside.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The moment I set foot within that rear door, I saw how it was a trap.
      There were a round dozen waiting, and each the flower of a desperate
      flock.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the first surprise of it I did not speak, but instinctively got the
      wall to my back. As I faced them they moved uneasily, half rising from
      their chairs, growling, but speaking no word. Their purpose was to attack
      me; yet they hung upon the edge of the enterprise, apparently in want of a
      leader. I was not a yard from the door, and having advantage of their
      slowness began making my way in that direction. They saw that I would
      escape, and yet they couldn't spur their courage to the leap. It was my
      perilous repute as a hitter from the shoulder that stood my friend that
      night.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last I reached the door. Opening it with my hand behind me, my eyes
      still on the glaring hesitating roughs, I stepped backward into the main
      room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-night, gentlemen,&rdquo; was all I said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You'll set up the gin, won't you?&rdquo; cried one, finding his voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sure!&rdquo; I returned, and I tossed Strong-Arm Dan a gold piece as I passed
      the bar. &ldquo;Give'em what they want while it lasts,&rdquo; said I.
    </p>
    <p>
      That demand for gin mashed into the teeth of my thoughts like the cogs of
      a wheel. It would hold that precious coterie for twenty minutes. When I
      got into the street, I caught the shadow of Sheeny Joe as he twisted
      around the corner.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a half-dozen blocks from the Tub of Blood that I blew the gathering
      call of the Tin Whistles. They came running like hounds to huntsman. Ten
      minutes later the Tub of Blood lay a pile of ruins, while Strong-Arm Dan
      and those others, surprised in the midst of that guzzling I had paid for,
      with heads and faces a hash of wounds and blood and the fear of death upon
      them, were running or staggering or crawling for shelter, according to
      what strength remained with them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's plain,&rdquo; said Big Kennedy, when I told of the net that Sheeny Joe had
      spread for me, &ldquo;it's plain that you haven't shed your milk-teeth yet.
      However, you'll be older by an' by, an' then you won't follow off every
      band of music that comes playin' down the street. No, I don't blame Sheeny
      Joe; politics is like draw-poker, an' everybody's got a right to fill his
      hand if he can. Still, while I don't blame him, it's up to us to get hunk
      an' even on th' play.&rdquo; Here Big Kennedy pondered for the space of a
      minute. Then he continued: &ldquo;I think we'd better make it up-the-river&mdash;better
      railroad the duffer. Discipline's been gettin' slack of late, an' an
      example will work in hot an' handy. The next crook won't pass us out the
      double-cross when he sees what comes off in th' case of Sheeny Joe.&rdquo;

      CHAPTER VIII&mdash;THE FATE OF SHEENY JOE
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">B</span>IG KENNEDY'S
      suggestion of Sing Sing for Sheeny Joe did not fit with my fancy. Not that
      a cropped head and a suit of stripes would have been misplaced in the
      instance of Sheeny Joe, but I had my reputation to consider. It would
      never do for a first bruiser of his day to fall back on the law for
      protection. Such coward courses would shake my standing beyond recovery.
      It would have disgraced the Tin Whistles; thereafter, in that vigorous
      brotherhood, my commands would have earned naught save laughter. To arrest
      Sheeny Joe would be to fly in the face of the Tin Whistles and their
      dearest ethics. When to this I called Big Kennedy's attention, he laughed
      as one amused.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don't twig!&rdquo; said he, recovering a partial gravity. &ldquo;I'm goin' to
      send him over th' road for robbery.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But he hasn't robbed anybody!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Big Kennedy made a gesture of impatience, mixed with despair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here!&rdquo; said he at last, &ldquo;I'll give you a flash of what I'm out to do an'
      why I'm out to do it. I'm goin' to put Sheeny Joe away to stiffen
      discipline. He's sold himself, an' th' whole ward knows it. Now I'm goin'
      to show'em what happens to a turncoat, as a hunch to keep their coats on
      right side out, d'ye see.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you spoke of a robbery!&rdquo; I interjected; &ldquo;Sheeny Joe has robbed no
      one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm gettin' to that,&rdquo; returned Big Kennedy, with a repressive wave of his
      broad palm, &ldquo;an' I can see that you yourself have a lot to learn. Listen:
      If I knew of any robbery Sheeny Joe had pulled off, I wouldn't have him
      lagged for that; no, not if he'd taken a jimmy an' cracked a dozen bins.
      There'd be no lesson in sendin' a duck over th' road in that. Any old
      woman could have him pinched for a crime he's really pulled off. To leave
      an impression on these people, you must send a party up for what he hasn't
      done. Then they understand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      For all Big Kennedy's explanation, I still lived in the dark. I made no
      return, however, either of comment or question; I considered that I had
      only to look on, and Big Kennedy's purpose would elucidate itself. Big
      Kennedy and I were in the sanctum that opened off his barroom. He called
      one of his barmen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Billy, you know where to find the Rat?&rdquo; Then, when the other nodded: &ldquo;Go
      an' tell the Rat I want him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who is the Rat?&rdquo; I queried. I had never heard of the Rat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He's a pickpocket,&rdquo; responded Big Kennedy, &ldquo;an' as fly a dip as ever
      nipped a watch or copped a leather.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Rat belonged on the west side of the town, which accounted for my
      having failed of his acquaintance. Big Kennedy was sure his man would find
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For he grafts nights,&rdquo; said Big Kennedy, &ldquo;an' at this time of day it's a
      cinch he's takin' a snooze. A pickpocket has to have plenty of sleep to
      keep his hooks from shakin'.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      While we were waiting the coming of the Rat, one of the barmen entered to
      announce a caller. He whispered a word in Big Kennedy's ear.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sure!&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;Tell him to come along.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The gentleman whom the barman had announced, and who was a young
      clergyman, came into the room. Big Kennedy gave him a hearty handshake,
      while his red face radiated a welcome.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it, Mr. Bronson?&rdquo; asked Big Kennedy pleasantly; &ldquo;what can I do
      for you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The young clergyman's purpose was to ask assistance for a mission which he
      proposed to start near the Five Points.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly,&rdquo; said Big Kennedy, &ldquo;an' not a moment to wait!&rdquo; With that he
      gave the young clergyman one hundred dollars.
    </p>
    <p>
      When that gentleman, after expressing his thanks, had departed, Big
      Kennedy sighed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I've got no great use for a church,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I never bought a gold
      brick yet that wasn't wrapped in a tract. But it's no fun to get a
      preacher down on you. One of'em can throw stones enough to smash every
      window in Tammany Hall. Your only show with the preachers is to flatter
      'em;&mdash;pass'em out the flowers. Most of 'em's as pleased with flattery
      as a girl. Yes indeed,&rdquo; he concluded, &ldquo;I can paste bills on 'em so long as
      I do it with soft soap.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Rat was a slight, quiet individual and looked the young physician
      rather than the pickpocket. His hands were delicate, and he wore gloves
      the better to keep them in condition. His step and air were as quiet as
      those of a cat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I want a favor,&rdquo; said Big Kennedy, addressing the Rat, &ldquo;an' I've got to
      go to one of the swell mob to get it. That's why I sent for you, d'ye see!
      It takes someone finer than a bricklayer to do th' work.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Rat was uneasily questioning my presence with his eye. Big Kennedy
      paused to reassure him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He's th' straight goods,&rdquo; said Big Kennedy, speaking in a tone wherein
      were mingled resentment and reproach. &ldquo;You don't s'ppose I'd steer you
      ag'inst a brace?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Rat said never a word, but his glance left me and he gave entire heed
      to Big Kennedy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is the proposition,&rdquo; resumed Big Kennedy. &ldquo;You know Sheeny Joe.
      Shadow him; swing and rattle with him no matter where he goes. The moment
      you see a chance, get a pocketbook an' put it away in his clothes. When
      th' roar goes up, tell th' loser where to look. Are you on? Sheeny Joe
      must get th' collar, an' I want him caught with th' goods, d'ye see.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't have to go to court ag'inst him?&rdquo; said the Rat interrogatively.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; retorted Big Kennedy, a bit explosively. &ldquo;You'd look about as well
      in th' witness box as I would in a pulpit. No, you shift th' leather. Then
      give th' party who's been touched th' office to go after Sheeny Joe. After
      that you can screw out; that's as far as you go.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was the next evening at the ferry. Suddenly a cry went up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thief! Thief! My pocketbook is gone!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The shouts found source in a broad man. He was top-heavy with too much
      beer, but clear enough to realize that his money had disappeared. The Rat,
      sly, small, clean, inconspicuous, was at his shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There's your man!&rdquo; whispered the Rat, pointing to Sheeny Joe, whose
      footsteps he had been dogging the livelong day; &ldquo;there's your man!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In a moment the broad man had thrown himself upon Sheeny Joe.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Call the police!&rdquo; he yelled. &ldquo;He's got my pocket-book!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The officer pulled him off Sheeny Joe, whom he had thrown to the ground
      and now clung to with the desperation of the robbed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Give me a look in!&rdquo; said the officer, thrusting the broad man aside. &ldquo;If
      he's got your leather we'll find it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sheeny Joe was breathless with the surprise and fury of the broad man's
      descent upon him. The officer ran his hand over the outside of Sheeny
      Joe's coat, holding him meanwhile fast by the collar. Then he slipped his
      hand inside, and drew forth a chubby pocketbook.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's it!&rdquo; screamed the broad man, &ldquo;that's my wallet with over six
      hundred dollars in it! The fellow stole it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's a plant!&rdquo; gasped Sheeny Joe, his face like ashes. Then to the crowd:
      &ldquo;Will somebody go fetch Big John Kennedy? He knows me; he'll say I'm
      square!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Big Kennedy arrived at the station as the officer, whose journey was slow
      because of the throng, came in with Sheeny Joe. Big Kennedy heard the
      stories of the officer and the broad man with all imaginable patience.
      Then a deep frown began to knot his brow. He waved Sheeny Joe aside with a
      gesture that told of virtuous indignation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lock him up!&rdquo; cried Big Kennedy. &ldquo;If he'd slugged somebody, even if he'd
      croaked him, I'd have stuck to him till th' pen'tentiary doors pinched my
      fingers. But I've no use for a crook. Sing Sing's th' place for him! It's
      just such fine workers as him who disgrace th' name of Tammany Hall. They
      lift a leather, an' they make Tammany a cover for th' play.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you goin' back on me?&rdquo; wailed Sheeny Joe.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Put him inside!&rdquo; said Big Kennedy to the officer in charge of the
      station. Then, to Sheeny Joe, with the flicker of a leer: &ldquo;Why don't you
      send to the Tub of Blood?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shall I take bail for him, Mr. Kennedy, if any shows up?&rdquo; asked the
      officer in charge.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; no bail!&rdquo; replied Big Kennedy. &ldquo;If anyone offers, tell him I don't
      want it done.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was three weeks later when Sheeny Joe was found guilty, and sentenced
      to prison for four years. The broad man, the police officer, and divers
      who at the time of his arrest were looking on, come forward as witnesses
      against Sheeny Joe, and twelve honest dullards who called themselves a
      jury, despite his protestations that he was &ldquo;being jobbed,&rdquo; instantly
      declared him guilty. Sheeny Joe, following his sentence, was dragged from
      the courtroom, crying and cursing the judge, the jury, the witnesses, but
      most of all Big Kennedy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nor do I think Big Kennedy's agency in drawing down this fate upon Sheeny
      Joe was misunderstood by ones with whom it was meant to pass for warning.
      I argue this from what was overheard by me as we left the courtroom where
      Sheeny Joe was sentenced. The two in conversation were walking a pace in
      advance of me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He got four spaces!&rdquo; said one in an awed whisper.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He's dead lucky not to go for life!&rdquo; exclaimed the other. &ldquo;How much of
      the double-cross do you guess now Big Kennedy will stand? I've seen a
      bloke take a slab in th' morgue for less. It was Benny the Bite; he gets a
      knife between his slats.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What's it all about, Jawn?&rdquo; asked Old Mike, who later sat in private
      review of the case of Sheeny Joe. &ldquo;Why are you puttin' a four-year smother
      on that laad?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's gettin' so,&rdquo; explained Big Kennedy, &ldquo;that these people of ours look
      on politics as a kind of Virginny reel. It's first dance on one side an'
      then cross to th' other. There's a bundle of money ag'inst us, big enough
      to trip a dog, an' discipline was givin' way. Our men could smell th'
      burnin' money an' it made 'em crazy. Somethin' had to come off to sober
      'em, an' teach 'em discipline, an' make 'em sing 'Home, Sweet Home'!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's all right, then!&rdquo; declared Old Mike decisively.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The main thing is to kape up th' organization! Better twinty like that
      Sheeny Joe should learn th' lockstep than weaken Tammany Hall. Besides,
      I'm not like th' law. I belave in sindin' folks to prison, not for what
      they do, but for what they are. An' this la-ad was a har-rd crackther.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The day upon which Sheeny Joe went to his prison was election day. Tammany
      Hall took possession of the town; and for myself, I was made an alderman
      by a majority that counted into the skies.

      CHAPTER IX&mdash;HOW BIG KENNEDY BOLTED
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">B</span>EFORE I abandon
      the late election in its history to the keeping of time past, there is an
      episode, or, if you will, an accident, which should find relation. Of
      itself it would have come and gone, and been of brief importance, save for
      an incident to make one of its elements, which in a later pinch to come of
      politics brought me within the shadow of a gibbet.
    </p>
    <p>
      Busy with my vote-getting, I had gone to the docks to confer with the head
      of a certain gang of stevedores. These latter were hustling up and down
      the gangplanks, taking the cargo out of a West India coffee boat. The one
      I had come seeking was aboard the vessel.
    </p>
    <p>
      I pushed towards the after gangplank, and as I reached it I stepped aside
      to avoid one coming ashore with a huge sack of coffee on his shoulders.
      Not having my eyes about me, I caught my toe in a ringbolt and stumbled
      with a mighty bump against a sailor who was standing on the string-piece
      of the wharf. With nothing to save him, and a six-foot space opening
      between the wharf and the ship, the man fell into the river with a cry and
      a splash. He went to the bottom like so much pig-iron, for he could not
      swim.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was the work of a moment to throw off my coat and go after him. I was
      as much at ease in the water as a spaniel, and there would be nothing more
      dangerous than a ducking in the experiment. I dived and came up with the
      drowning man in my grip. For all his peril, he took it coolly enough, and
      beyond spluttering, and puffing, and cracking off a jargon of oaths, added
      no difficulties to the task of saving his life. We gained help from the
      dock, and it wasn't five minutes before we found the safe planks beneath
      our feet again.
    </p>
    <p>
      The man who had gone overboard so unexpectedly was a keen small dark
      creature of a Sicilian, and to be noticed for his black eyes, a red
      handkerchief over his head, and ears looped with golden earrings.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No harm done, I think?&rdquo; said I, when we were both ashore again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I lose-a my knife,&rdquo; said he with a grin, the water dripping from his
      hair. He was pointing to the empty scabbard at his belt where he had
      carried a sheath-knife.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was my blunder,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;and if you'll hunt me up at Big Kennedy's
      this evening I'll have another for you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      That afternoon, at a pawnshop in the Bowery, I bought a strange-looking
      weapon, that was more like a single-edged dagger than anything else. It
      had a buck-horn haft, and was heavy and long, with a blade of full nine
      inches.
    </p>
    <p>
      My Sicilian came, as I had told him, and I gave him the knife. He was
      extravagant in his gratitude.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You owe me nothing!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;It is I who owe for my life that you
      save. But I shall take-a the knife to remember how you pull me out. You
      good-a man; some day I pull you out&mdash;mebby so! who knows?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With that he was off for the docks again, leaving me neither to hear nor
      to think of him thereafter for a stirring handful of years.
    </p>
    <p>
      It occurred to me as strange, even in a day when I gave less time to
      thought than I do now, that my first impulse as an alderman should be one
      of revenge. There was that police captain, who, in the long ago, offered
      insult to Anne, when she came to beg for my liberty. &ldquo;Better get back to
      your window,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;or all the men will have left the street!&rdquo; The
      memory of that evil gibe had never ceased to burn me with the hot anger of
      a coal of fire, and now I resolved for his destruction.
    </p>
    <p>
      When I told Big Kennedy, he turned the idea on his wheel of thought for
      full two minutes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's your right,&rdquo; said he at last. &ldquo;You've got the ax; you're entitled to
      his head. But say! pick him up on proper charges; get him dead to rights!
      That aint hard, d'ye see, for he's as crooked as a dog's hind leg. To
      throw him for some trick he's really turned will bunco these reform guys
      into thinkin' that we're on th' level.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The enterprise offered no complexities. A man paid that captain money to
      save from suppression a resort of flagrant immorality. The bribery was
      laid bare; he was overtaken in this plain corruption; and next, my
      combinations being perfect, I broke him as I might break a stick across my
      knee. He came to me in private the following day.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What have I done?&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;Can I square it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never!&rdquo; I retorted; &ldquo;there's some things one can't square.&rdquo; Then I told
      him of Anne, and his insult.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's enough,&rdquo; he replied, tossing his hand resignedly. &ldquo;I can take my
      medicine when it's come my turn.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      For all that captain's stoicism, despair rang in his tones, and as he left
      me, the look in his eye was one to warm the cockles of my heart and feed
      my soul with comfort.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Speakin' for myself,&rdquo; said Big Kennedy, in the course of comment, &ldquo;I
      don't go much on revenge. Still when it costs nothin', I s'ppose you might
      as well take it in. Besides, it shows folks that there's a dead-line in
      th' game. The wise ones will figger that this captain held out on us, or
      handed us th' worst of it on th' quiet. The example of him gettin' done up
      will make others run true.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Several years slipped by wherein as alderman I took my part in the town's
      affairs. I was never a talking member, and gained no glory for my
      eloquence. But what I lacked of rhetoric, I made up in stubborn loyalty to
      Tammany, and I never failed to dispose of my vote according to its
      mandates.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was not alone my right, but my duty to do this. I had gone to the polls
      the avowed candidate of the machine. There was none to vote for me who did
      not know that my public courses would be shaped and guided by the
      organization. I was free to assume, therefore, being thus elected as a
      Tammany member by folk informed to a last expression of all that the
      phrase implied, that I was bound to carry out the Tammany programmes and
      execute the Tammany orders. Where a machine and its laws are known, the
      people when they lift to office one proposed of that machine, thereby
      direct such officer to submit himself to its direction and conform to its
      demands.
    </p>
    <p>
      There will be ones to deny this. And these gentry of denials will be
      plausible, and furnish the thought of an invincible purity for their
      assumptions. They should not, however, be too sure for their theories.
      They themselves may be the ones in error. They should reflect that
      wherever there dwells a Yes there lives also a No. These contradictionists
      should emulate my own forbearance.
    </p>
    <p>
      I no more claim to be wholly right for my attitude of implicit obedience
      to the machine, than I condemn as wholly wrong their own position of
      boundless denunciation. There is no man so bad he may not be defended;
      there lives none so good he does not need defense; and what I say of a man
      might with equal justice be said of any dogma of politics. As I set forth
      in my preface, the true and the false, the black and the white in politics
      will rest ever with the point of view.
    </p>
    <p>
      During my years as an alderman I might have made myself a wealthy man. And
      that I did not do so, was not because I had no profit of the place. As the
      partner, unnamed, in sundry city contracts, riches came often within my
      clutch. But I could not keep them; I was born with both hands open and had
      the hold of money that a riddle has of water.
    </p>
    <p>
      This want of a money wit is a defect of my nature. A great merchant late
      in my life once said to me:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Commerce&mdash;money-getting&mdash;is like a sea, and every man, in large
      or little sort, is a mariner. Some are buccaneers, while others are sober
      merchantmen. One lives by taking prizes, the other by the proper gains of
      trade. You belong to the buccaneers by your birth. You are not a business
      man, but a business wolf. Being a wolf, you will waste and never save.
      Your instinct is to pull down each day's beef each day. You should never
      buy nor sell nor seek to make money with money. Your knowledge of money is
      too narrow. Up to fifty dollars you are wise. Beyond that point you are
      the greatest dunce I ever met.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Thus lectured the man of markets, measuring sticks, and scales; and while
      I do not think him altogether exact, there has been much in my story to
      bear out what he said. It was not that I wasted my money in riot, or in
      vicious courses. My morals were good, and I had no vices. This was not
      much to my credit; my morals were instinctive, like the morals of an
      animal. My one passion was for politics, and my one ambition the ambition
      to lead men. Nor was I eager to hold office; my hope went rather to a day
      when I should rule Tammany as its Chief. My genius was not for the show
      ring; I cared nothing for a gilded place. That dream of my heart's wish
      was to be the power behind the screen, and to put men up and take men
      down, place them and move them about, and play at government as one might
      play at chess. Still, while I dreamed of an unbridled day to come, I was
      for that the more sedulous to execute the orders of Big Kennedy. I had not
      then to learn that the art of command is best studied in the art of
      obedience.
    </p>
    <p>
      To be entirely frank, I ought to name the one weakness that beset me, and
      which more than any spendthrift tendency lost me my fortune as fast as it
      flowed in. I came never to be a gambler in the card or gaming table sense,
      but I was inveterate to wager money on a horse. While money lasted, I
      would bet on the issue of every race that was run, and I was made
      frequently bankrupt thereby. However, I have said enough of my want of
      capacity to hoard. I was young and careless; moreover, with my place as
      alderman, and that sovereignty I still held among the Red Jackets, when my
      hand was empty I had but to stretch it forth to have it filled again.
    </p>
    <p>
      In my boyhood I went garbed of rags and patches. Now when money came, I
      sought the first tailor of the town. I went to him drawn of his high
      prices; for I argued, and I think sagaciously, that where one pays the
      most one gets the best.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nor, when I found that tailor, did I seek to direct him in his labors. I
      put myself in his hands, and was guided to quiet blacks and grays, and at
      his hint gave up thoughts of those plaids and glaring checks to which my
      tastes went hungering. That tailor dressed me like a gentleman and did me
      a deal of good. I am not one to say that raiment makes the man, and yet I
      hold that it has much to do with the man's behavior. I can say in my own
      case that when I was thus garbed like a gentleman, my conduct was at once
      controlled in favor of the moderate. I was instantly ironed of those
      rougher wrinkles of my nature, which last, while neither noisy nor
      gratuitously violent, was never one of peace.
    </p>
    <p>
      The important thing was that these clothes of gentility gave me multiplied
      vogue with ones who were peculiarly my personal followers. They earned me
      emphasis with my Red Jackets, who still bore me aloft as their leader, and
      whose favor I must not let drift. The Tin Whistles, too, drew an awe from
      this rich yet civil uniform which strengthened my authority in that
      muscular quarter. I had grown, as an alderman and that one next in ward
      power to Big Kennedy, to a place which exempted me from those harsher
      labors of fist and bludgeon in which, whenever the exigencies of a
      campaign demanded, the Tin Whistles were still employed. But I claimed my
      old mastery over them. I would not permit so hardy a force to go to
      another's hands, and while I no longer led their war parties, I was always
      in the background, giving them direction and stopping them when they went
      too far.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was demanded of my safety that I retain my hold upon both the Tin
      Whistles and the Red Jackets. However eminent I might be, I was by no
      means out of the ruck, and my situation was to be sustained only by the
      strong hand. The Tin Whistles and the Red Jackets were the sources of my
      importance, and if my voice were heeded or my word owned weight it was
      because they stood ever ready to my call. Wherefore, I cultivated their
      favor, secured my place among them, while at the same time I forced them
      to obey to the end that they as well as I be preserved.
    </p>
    <p>
      Those clothes of a gentleman not only augmented, but declared my strength.
      In that time a fine coat was an offense to ones more coarsely clothed. A
      well-dressed stranger could not have walked three blocks on the East Side
      without being driven to do battle for his life. Fine linen was esteemed a
      challenge, and that I should be so arrayed and go unscathed, proved not
      alone my popularity, but my dangerous repute. Secretly, it pleased my
      shoulder-hitters to see their captain so garbed; and since I could defend
      my feathers, they made of themselves another reason of leadership. I was
      growing adept of men, and I counted on this effect when I spent my money
      with that tailor.
    </p>
    <p>
      While I thus lay aside for the moment the running history of events that
      were as the stepping stones by which I crossed from obscurity and poverty
      to power and wealth, to have a glance at myself in my more personal
      attitudes, I should also relate my marriage and how I took a wife. It was
      Anne who had charge of the business, and brought me this soft victory. Had
      it not been for Anne, I more than half believe I would have had no wife at
      all; for I was eaten of an uneasy awkwardness whenever my fate delivered
      me into the presence of a girl. However earnestly Anne might counsel, I
      had no more of parlor wisdom than a savage, Anne, while sighing over my
      crudities and the hopeless thickness of my wits, established herself as a
      bearward to supervise my conduct. She picked out my wife for me, and in
      days when I should have been a lover, but was a graven image and as
      stolid, carried forward the courting in my stead.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was none other than Apple Cheek upon whom Anne pitched&mdash;Apple
      Cheek, grown rounder and more fair, with locks like cornsilk, and eyes of
      even a deeper blue than on that day of the docks. Anne had struck out a
      friendship for Apple Cheek from the beginning, and the two were much in
      one another's company. And so one day, by ways and means I was too much
      confused to understand, Anne had us before the priest. We were made
      husband and wife; Apple Cheek brave and sweet, I looking like a fool in
      need of keepers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Anne, the architect of this bliss, was in tears; and yet she must have
      kept her head, for I remember how she recalled me to the proprieties of my
      new station.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why don't you kiss your bride!&rdquo; cried Anne, at the heel of the ceremony.
    </p>
    <p>
      Anne snapped out the words, and they rang in my delinquent ears like a
      storm bell. Apple Cheek, eyes wet to be a match for Anne's, put up her
      lips with all the courage in the world. I kissed her, much as one might
      salute a hot flatiron. Still I kissed her; and I think to the satisfaction
      of a church-full looking on; but I knew what men condemned have felt on
      that journey to block and ax.
    </p>
    <p>
      Apple Cheek and her choice of me made up the sweetest fortune of my life,
      and now when I think of her it is as if I stood in a flood of sunshine. So
      far as I was able, I housed her and robed her as though she were the
      daughter of a king, and while I have met treason in others and desertion
      where I looked for loyalty, I held her heart-fast, love-fast, faith-fast,
      ever my own. She was my treasure, and when she died it was as though my
      own end had come.
    </p>
    <p>
      Big Kennedy and the then Chief of Tammany, during my earlier years as
      alderman, were as Jonathan and David. They were ever together, and their
      plans and their interests ran side by side. At last they began to fall
      apart. Big Kennedy saw a peril in this too-close a partnership, and was
      for putting distance between them. It was Old Mike who thus counseled him.
      The aged one became alarmed by the raw and insolent extravagance of the
      Chief's methods.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Th' public,&rdquo; said Old Mike, &ldquo;is a sheep, while ye do no more than just
      rob it. But if ye insult it, it's a wolf. Now this man insults th' people.
      Better cut loose from him, Jawn; he'll get ye all tor-rn to pieces.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The split came when, by suggestion of Old Mike and
    </p>
    <p>
      Big Kennedy, I refused to give my vote as alderman to a railway company
      asking a terminal. There were millions of dollars in the balance, and
      without my vote the machine and the railway company were powerless. The
      stress was such that the mighty Chief himself came down to Big Kennedy's
      saloon&mdash;a sight to make men stare!
    </p>
    <p>
      The two, for a full hour, were locked in Big Kennedy's sanctum; when they
      appeared I could read in the black anger that rode on the brow of the
      Chief how Big Kennedy had declined his orders, and now stood ready to
      abide the worst. Big Kennedy, for his side, wore an air of confident
      serenity, and as I looked at the pair and compared them, one black, the
      other beaming, I was surprised into the conviction that Big Kennedy of the
      two was the superior natural force. As the Chief reached the curb he said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know the meaning of this. I shall tear you in two in the middle an'
      leave you on both sides of the street!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you do, I'll never squeal,&rdquo; returned Big Kennedy carelessly. &ldquo;But you
      can't; I've got you counted. I can hold the ward ag'inst all you'll send.
      An' you look out for yourself! I'll throw a switch on you yet that'll send
      you to th' scrapheap.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I s'ppose you think you know what you're doin'?&rdquo; said the other angrily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You can put a bet on it that I do,&rdquo; retorted Big Kennedy. &ldquo;I wasn't born
      last week.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      That evening as we sat silent and thoughtful, Big Kennedy broke forth with
      a word.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I've got it! You're on speakin' terms with that old duffer, Morton, who's
      forever talkin' about bein' a taxpayer. He likes you, since you laid out
      Jimmy the Blacksmith that time. See him, an' fill him up with th' notion
      that he ought to go to Congress. It won't be hard; he's sure he ought to
      go somewhere, an' Congress will fit him to a finish. In two days he'll
      think he's on his way to be a second Marcy. Tell him that if his people
      will put him up, we'll join dogs with 'em an' pull down th' place. You can
      say that we can't stand th' dishonesty an' corruption at th' head of
      Tammany Hall, an' are goin' to make a bolt for better government. We'll
      send the old sport to Congress. He'll give us a bundle big enough to fight
      the machine, an' plank dollar for dollar with it. An' it'll put us in line
      for a hook-up with th' reform bunch in th' fight for th' town next year.
      It's the play to make; we're goin' to see stormy weather, you an' me, an'
      it's our turn to make for cover. We'll put up this old party, Morton, an'
      give th' machine a jolt. Th' Chief'll leave me on both sides of th'
      street, will he? I'll make him think, before he's through, that he's run
      ag'inst th' pole of a dray.&rdquo;
     </p>

    <h2>
      CHAPTER X&mdash;HOW JIMMY THE BLACKSMITH DIED
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">B</span>IG KENNEDY was
      right; the reputable old gentleman rose to that lure of Congress like any
      bass to any fly. It was over in a trice, those preliminaries; he was proud
      to be thus called upon to serve the people. Incidentally, it restored his
      hope in the country's future to hear that such tried war-dogs of politics
      as Big Kennedy and myself were making a line of battle against dishonesty
      in place. These and more were said to me by the reputable old gentleman
      when I bore him that word how Big Kennedy and I were ready to be his
      allies. The reputable old gentleman puffed and glowed with the sheer glory
      of my proposal, and seemed already to regard his election as a thing
      secured.
    </p>
    <p>
      In due course, his own tribe placed him in nomina-ton. That done, Big
      Kennedy called a meeting of his people and declared for the reputable old
      gentleman's support. Big Kennedy did not wait to be attacked by the
      Tammany machine; he took the initiative and went to open rebellion, giving
      as his reason the machine's corruption.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tammany Hall has fallen into the hands of thieves!&rdquo; shouted Big Kennedy,
      in a short but pointed address which he made to his clansmen. &ldquo;As an
      honest member of Tammany, I am fighting to rescue the organization.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In its way, the move was a master-stroke. It gave us the high ground,
      since it left us still in the party, still in Tammany Hall. It gave us a
      position and a battle-cry, and sent us into the conflict with a cleaner
      fame than it had been our wont to wear.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the beginning, the reputable old gentleman paid a pompous visit to Big
      Kennedy. Like all who saw that leader, the reputable old gentleman came to
      Big Kennedy's saloon. This last was a point upon which Big Kennedy never
      failed to insist.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Th' man,&rdquo; said Big Kennedy, &ldquo;who's too good to go into a saloon, is too
      good to go into politics; if he's goin' to dodge th' one, he'd better duck
      the' other.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The reputable old gentleman met this test of the barrooms, and qualified
      for politics without a quaver. Had a barroom been the shelter of his
      infancy, he could not have worn a steadier assurance. As he entered, he
      laid a bill on the bar for the benefit of the public then and there
      athirst. Next he intimated a desire to talk privately with Big Kennedy,
      and set his course for the sanctum as though by inspiration. Big Kennedy
      called me to the confab; closing the door behind us, we drew together
      about the table.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let's cut out th' polite prelim'naries,&rdquo; said Big Kennedy, &ldquo;an' come down
      to tacks. How much stuff do you feel like blowin' in?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How much should it take?&rdquo; asked the reputable old gentleman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Say twenty thousand!&rdquo; returned Big Kennedy, as cool as New Year's Day.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Twenty thousand dollars!&rdquo; repeated the reputable old gentleman, with wide
      eyes. &ldquo;Will it call for so much as that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you're goin' to put in money, put in enough to win. There's no sense
      puttin' in just enough to lose. Th' other fellows will come into th'
      district with money enough to burn a wet dog. We've got to break even with
      'em, or they'll have us faded from th' jump.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But what can you do with so much?&rdquo; asked the reputable old gentleman
      dismally. &ldquo;It seems a fortune! What would you do with it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mass meetin's, bands, beer, torches, fireworks, halls; but most of all,
      buy votes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Buy votes!&rdquo; exclaimed the reputable old gentleman, his cheek paling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Buy 'em by th' bunch, like a market girl sells radishes!&rdquo; Then, seeing
      the reputable old gentleman's horror: &ldquo;How do you s'ppose you're goin' to
      get votes? You don't think that these dock-wallopers an' river pirates are
      stuck on you personally, do you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But their interest as citizens! I should think they'd look at that!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Their first interest as citizens,&rdquo; observed Big Kennedy, with a cynical
      smile, &ldquo;is a five-dollar bill.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But do you think it right to purchase votes?&rdquo; asked the reputable old
      gentleman, with a gasp.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it right to shoot a man? No. Is it right to shoot a man if he's
      shootin' at you? Yes. Well, these mugs are goin' to buy votes, an' keep at
      it early an' late. Which is why I say it's dead right to buy votes to save
      yourself. Besides, you're th' best man; it's th' country's welfare we're
      protectin', d'ye see!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The reputable old gentleman remained for a moment in deep thought. Then he
      got upon his feet to go.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll send my son to talk with you,&rdquo; he said. Then faintly: &ldquo;I guess this
      will be all right.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There's somethin' you've forgot,&rdquo; said Big Kennedy with a chuckle, as he
      shook hands with the reputable old gentleman when the latter was about to
      depart; &ldquo;there's a bet you've overlooked.&rdquo; Then, as the other seemed
      puzzled: &ldquo;You aint got off your bluff about bein' a taxpayer. But, I
      understand! This is exec'tive session, an' that crack about bein' a
      taxpayer is more of a public utterance. You're keepin' it for th' stump,
      most likely.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll send my son to you to-night,&rdquo; repeated the reputable old gentleman,
      too much in the fog of Big Kennedy's generous figures to heed his jests
      about taxpayers. &ldquo;He'll be here about eight o'clock.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's right!&rdquo; said Big Kennedy. &ldquo;The sooner we get th' oil, th' sooner
      we'll begin to light up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The reputable old gentleman kept his word concerning his son and that
      young gentleman's advent. The latter was with us at eight, sharp, and
      brought two others of hard appearance to bear him company as a kind of
      bodyguard. The young gentleman was slight and superfine, with eyeglass,
      mustache, and lisp. He accosted Big Kennedy, swinging a dainty cane the
      while in an affected way.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm Mr. Morton&mdash;Mr. James Morton,&rdquo; he drawled. &ldquo;You know my father.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Once in the sanctum, and none save Big Kennedy and myself for company,
      young Morton came to the question.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My father's running for Congress. But he's old-fashioned; he doesn't
      understand these things.&rdquo; The tones were confident and sophisticated. I
      began to see how the eyeglass, the cane, and the lisp belied our caller.
      Under his affectations, he was as keen and cool a hand as Big Kennedy
      himself. &ldquo;No,&rdquo; he repeated, taking meanwhile a thick envelope from his
      frock-coat, &ldquo;he doesn't understand. The idea of money shocks him, don't y'
      know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's it!&rdquo; returned Big Kennedy, sympathetically. &ldquo;He's old-fashioned;
      he thinks this thing is like runnin' to be superintendent of a Sunday
      school. He aint down to date.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here,&rdquo; observed our visitor, tapping the table with the envelope, and
      smiling to find himself and Big Kennedy a unit as to the lamentable
      innocence of his father, &ldquo;here are twenty one-thousand-dollar bills. I
      didn't draw a check for reasons you appreciate. I shall trust you to make
      the best use of this money. Also, I shall work with you through the
      campaign.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With that, the young gentleman went his way, humming a tune; and all as
      though leaving twenty thousand dollars in the hands of some chance-sown
      politician was the common employment of his evenings. When he was gone,
      Big Kennedy opened the envelope. There they were; twenty
      one-thousand-dollar bills. Big Kennedy pointed to them as they lay on the
      table.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There's the reformer for you!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;He'll go talkin' about Tammany
      Hall; but once he himself goes out for an office, he's ready to buy a vote
      or burn a church! But say! that young Morton's all right!&rdquo; Here Big
      Kennedy's manner betrayed the most profound admiration. &ldquo;He's as flossy a
      proposition as ever came down th' pike.&rdquo; Then his glance recurred
      doubtfully to the treasure. &ldquo;I wish he'd brought it 'round by daylight.
      I'll have to set up with this bundle till th' bank opens. Some fly guy
      might cop a sneak on it else. There's a dozen of my best customers, any of
      whom would croak a man for one of them bills.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The campaign went forward rough and tumble. Big Kennedy spent money like
      water, the Red Jackets never slept, while the Tin Whistles met the
      plug-uglies of the enemy on twenty hard-fought fields.
    </p>
    <p>
      The only move unusual, however, was one made by that energetic exquisite,
      young Morton. Young Morton, in the thick from the first, went shoulder to
      shoulder with Big Kennedy and myself. One day he asked us over to his
      personal headquarters.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know,&rdquo; said he, with his exasperating lisp, and daintily adjusting
      his glasses, &ldquo;how there's a lot of negroes to live over this way&mdash;quite
      a settlement of them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; returned Big Kennedy, &ldquo;there's about three hundred votes among 'em.
      I've never tried to cut in on 'em, because there's no gettin' a nigger to
      vote th' Tammany ticket.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Three hundred votes, did you say?&rdquo; lisped the youthful manager. &ldquo;I shall
      get six hundred.&rdquo; Then, to a black who was hovering about: &ldquo;Call in those
      new recruits.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Six young blacks, each with a pleasant grin, marched into the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There,&rdquo; said young Morton, inspecting them with the close air of a
      critic, &ldquo;they look like the real thing, don't they? Don't you think
      they'll pass muster?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An' why not?&rdquo; said Big Kennedy. &ldquo;I take it they're game to swear to their
      age, an' have got sense enough to give a house number that's in th'
      district?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's not that,&rdquo; returned young Morton languidly. &ldquo;But these fellows
      aren't men, old chap, they're women, don't y' know! It's the clothes does
      it. I'm going to dress up the wenches in overalls and jumpers; it's my own
      little idea.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Say!&rdquo; said Big Kennedy solemnly, as we were on our return; &ldquo;that young
      Morton beats four kings an' an ace. He's a bird! I never felt so much like
      takin' off my hat to a man in my life. An' to think he's a Republican!&rdquo;
       Here Big Kennedy groaned over genius misplaced. &ldquo;There's no use talkin';
      he ought to be in Tammany Hall.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The district which was to determine the destinies of the reputable old
      gentleman included two city wards besides the one over which Big Kennedy
      held sway. The campaign was not two weeks old before it stood patent to a
      dullest eye that Big Kennedy, while crowded hard, would hold his place as
      leader in spite of the Tammany Chief and the best efforts he could put
      forth. When this was made apparent, while the strife went forward as
      fiercely as before, the Chief sent overtures to Big Kennedy. If that
      rebellionist would return to the fold of the machine, bygones would be
      bygones, and a feast of love and profit would be spread before him. Big
      Kennedy, when the olive branch was proffered, sent word that he would meet
      the Chief next day. He would be at a secret place he named.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An' tell him to come alone,&rdquo; said Big Kennedy to the messenger. &ldquo;That's
      th' way I'll come; an' if he goes to ringin' in two or three for this
      powwow, you can say to him in advance it's all off.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Following the going of the messenger, Big Kennedy fell into a brown study.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you think you'll deal in again with the Chief and the machine?&rdquo; I
      asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It depends on what's offered. A song an' dance won't get me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But how about the Mortons? Would you abandon them?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Big Kennedy looked me over with an eye of pity. Then he placed his hand on
      my head, as on that far-off day in court.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You're learnin' politics,&rdquo; said Big Kennedy slowly, &ldquo;an' you're showin'
      speed. But let me tell you: You must chuck sentiment. Quit th' Mortons?
      I'll quit 'em in a holy minute if th' bid comes strong enough.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Would you quit your friends?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's different,&rdquo; he returned. &ldquo;No man ought to quit his friends. But
      you must be careful an' never have more'n two or three, d'ye see. Now
      these Mortons aint friends, they're confed'rates. It's as though we
      happened to be members of the same band of porch-climbers, that's all.
      Take it this way: How long do you guess it would take the Mortons to sell
      us out if it matched their little game? How long do you think we'd last?
      Well, we'd last about as long as a drink of whisky.&rdquo; Big Kennedy met the
      Chief, and came back shaking his head in decisive negative.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There's nothin' in it,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;he's all for playin' th' hog. It's that
      railway company's deal. Your vote as Alderman, mind you, wins or loses it!
      What do you think now he offers to do? I know what he gets. He gets stock,
      say two hundred thousand dollars, an' one hundred thousand dollars in cold
      cash. An' yet he talks of only splittin' out fifteen thousand for you an'
      me! Enough said; we fight him!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jimmy the Blacksmith, when, in response to Big Kennedy's hint, he
      &ldquo;followed Gaffney,&rdquo; pitched his tent in the ward next north of our own. He
      made himself useful to the leader of that region, and called together a
      somber bevy which was known as the Alley Gang. With that care for himself
      which had ever marked his conduct, Jimmy the Blacksmith, and his Alley
      Gang, while they went to and fro as shoulder-hitters of the machine, were
      zealous to avoid the Tin Whistles, and never put themselves within their
      reach. On the one or two occasions when the Tin Whistles, lusting for
      collision, went hunting them, the astute Alleyites were no more to be
      discovered than a needle in the hay.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You couldn't find 'em with a search warrant!&rdquo; reported my disgusted
      lieutenant. &ldquo;I never saw such people! They're a disgrace to th' East
      Side.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      However, they were to be found with the last of it, and it would have been
      a happier fortune for me had the event fallen the other way.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was the day of the balloting, and Big Kennedy and I had taken measures
      to render the result secure. Not only would we hold our ward, but the
      district and the reputable old gentleman were safe. Throughout the morning
      the word that came to us from time to time was ever a white one. It was
      not until the afternoon that information arrived of sudden clouds to fill
      the sky. The news came in the guise of a note from young Morton:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jimmy the Blacksmith and his heelers are driving our people from the
      polls.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know what to do!&rdquo; said Big Kennedy, tossing me the scrap of paper.
    </p>
    <p>
      With the Tin Whistles at my heels, I made my way to the scene of trouble.
      It was full time; for a riot was on, and our men were winning the worst of
      the fray. Clubs were going and stones were being thrown.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the heart of it, I had a glimpse of Jimmy the Blacksmith, a slungshot
      to his wrist, smiting right and left, and cheering his cohorts. The sight
      gladdened me. There was my man, and I pushed through the crowd to reach
      him. This last was no stubborn matter, for the press parted before me like
      water.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jimmy the Blacksmith saw me while yet I was a dozen feet from him. He
      understood that he could not escape, and with that he desperately faced
      me. As I drew within reach, he leveled a savage blow with the slungshot.
      It would have put a period to my story if I had met it. The shot
      miscarried, however, and the next moment I had rushed him and pinned him
      against the walls of the warehouse in which the precinct's polls were
      being held.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I've got you!&rdquo; I cried, and then wrenched myself free to give me
      distance.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was to strike no blow, however; my purpose was to find an interruption
      in midswing. While the words were between my teeth, something like a
      sunbeam came flickering by my head, and a long knife buried itself
      vengefully in Jimmy the Blacksmith's throat. There was a choking gurgle;
      the man fell forward upon me while the red torrent from his mouth covered
      my hands. Then he crumpled to the ground in a weltering heap; dead on the
      instant, too, for the point had pierced the spine. In a dumb chill of
      horror, I stooped and drew forth the knife. It was that weapon of the
      Bowery pawnshop which I had given the Sicilian.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XI&mdash;HOW THE BOSS STOOD AT BAY FOR HIS LIFE
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">W</span>HEN I gave that
      knife to the Sicilian, I had not thought how on the next occasion that I
      encountered it I should draw it from the throat of a dead and fallen
      enemy. With the sight of it there arose a vision of the dark brisk face,
      the red kerchief, and the golden earrings of him to whom it had been
      presented. In a blurred way I swept the throng for his discovery. The
      Sicilian was not there; my gaze met only the faces of the common crowd&mdash;ghastly,
      silent, questioning, staring, as I stood with knife dripping blood and the
      dead man on the ground at my feet. A police officer was pushing slowly
      towards me, his face cloudy with apology.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You mustn't hold this ag'inst me,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;but you can see yourself, I
      can't turn my blind side to a job like this. They'd have me pegged out an'
      spread-eagled in every paper of th' town.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes!&rdquo; I replied vaguely, not knowing what I said. &ldquo;An' there's th' big
      Tammany Chief you're fightin',&rdquo; went on the officer; &ldquo;he'd just about have
      my scalp, sure. I don't see why you did it! Your heart must be turnin'
      weak, when you take to carryin' a shave, an' stickin' people like pigs!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don't think I killed him!&rdquo; I exclaimed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who else?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      The officer shrugged his shoulders and turned his hands palm upwards with
      a gesture of deprecation. To the question and the gesture I made no
      answer. It came to me that I must give my Sicilian time to escape. I could
      have wished his friendship had taken a less tropical form; still he had
      thrown that knife for me, and I would not name him until he had found his
      ship and was safe beyond the fingers of the law. Even now I think my
      course a proper one. The man innocent has ever that innocence to be his
      shield; he should be ready to suffer a little in favor of ones who own no
      such strong advantage.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was nine of that evening's clock before Big Kennedy visited me in the
      Tombs. Young Morton came with him, clothed of evening dress and wearing
      white gloves. He twisted his mustache between his kid-gloved finger and
      thumb, meanwhile surveying the grimy interior&mdash;a fretwork of steel
      bars and freestone&mdash;with looks of ineffable objection. The warden was
      with them in his own high person when they came to my cell. That
      functionary was in a mood of sullen uncertainty; he could not make out a
      zone of safety for himself, when now Big Kennedy and the Tammany Chief
      were at daggers drawn. He feared he might go too far in pleasuring the
      former, and so bring upon him the dangerous resentment of his rival.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We can't talk here, Dave,&rdquo; said Big Kennedy, addressing the warden, after
      greeting me through the cell grate. &ldquo;Bring him to your private office.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, Mr. Kennedy,&rdquo; remonstrated the warden, &ldquo;I don't know about that.
      It's after lockin'-up hours now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don't know!&rdquo; repeated Big Kennedy, the specter of a threat peeping
      from his gray eyes. &ldquo;An' you're to hand me out a line of guff about
      lockin'-up hours, too! Come, come, Dave; it won't do to get chesty! The
      Chief an' I may be pals to-morrow. Or I may have him done for an' on th'
      run in a month. Where would you be then, Dave? No more words, I say: bring
      him to your private office.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was no gainsaying the masterful manner of Big Kennedy. The warden,
      weakened with years of fear of him and his power, grumblingly undid the
      bolts and led the way to his room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Deuced wretched quarters, I should say!&rdquo; murmured young Morton, glancing
      for a moment inside the cell. &ldquo;Not at all worth cutting a throat for.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When we were in the warden's room, that master of the keys took up a
      position by the door. This was not to Big Kennedy's taste.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dave, s'ppose you step outside,&rdquo; said Big Kennedy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's no use you hearin' what we say; it might get you into trouble, d'ye
      see!&rdquo; The last, insinuatingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Kennedy, I'm afraid!&rdquo; replied the warden, with the voice of one
      worried. &ldquo;You know the charge is murder. He's here for killin' Jimmy the
      Blacksmith. I've no right to let him out of my sight.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To be sure, I know it's murder,&rdquo; responded Big Kennedy. &ldquo;I'd be plankin'
      down bail for him if it was anything else. But what's that got to do with
      you skip-pin' into th' hall? You don't think I'm goin' to pass him any
      files or saws, do you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Really, Mr. Warden,&rdquo; said young Morton, crossing over to where the warden
      lingered irresolutely, &ldquo;really, you don't expect to stay and overhear our
      conversation! Why, it would be not only impolite, but perposterous!
      Besides, it's not my way, don't y' know!&rdquo; And here young Morton put on his
      double eyeglass and ran the warden up and down with an intolerant stare.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But he's charged, I tell you,&rdquo; objected the warden, &ldquo;with killin' Jimmy
      th' Blacksmith. I can't go to givin' him privileges an' takin' chances;
      I'd get done up if I did.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You'll get done up if you don't!&rdquo; growled Big Kennedy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is as you say,&rdquo; went on young Morton, still holding the warden in the
      thrall of that wonderful eyeglass, &ldquo;it is quite true that this person,
      James the Horseshoer as you call him, has been slain and will never shoe a
      horse again. But our friend had no hand in it, as we stand ready to spend
      one hundred thousand dollars to establish. And by the way, speaking of
      money,&rdquo;&mdash;here young Morton turned to Big Kennedy&mdash;&ldquo;didn't you
      say as we came along that it would be proper to remunerate this officer
      for our encroachments upon his time?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, yes,&rdquo; replied Big Kennedy, with an ugly glare at the warden, &ldquo;I said
      that it might be a good idea to sweeten him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sweeten! Ah, yes; I recall now that sweeten was the term you employed. A
      most extraordinary word for paying money. However,&rdquo; and here young Morton
      again addressed the warden, tendering him at the same time a
      one-hundred-dollar bill, &ldquo;here is a small present. Now let us have no more
      words, my good man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The warden, softened by the bill, went out and closed the door. I could
      see that he looked on young Morton in wonder and smelled upon him a
      mysterious authority. As one disposed to cement a friendship just begun,
      the warden, as he left, held out his hand to young Morton.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You're th' proper caper!&rdquo; he exclaimed, in a gush of encomium; &ldquo;you're a
      gent of th' right real sort!&rdquo; Young Morton gazed upon the warden's
      outstretched hand as though it were one of the curious things of nature.
      At. last he extended two fingers, which the warden grasped.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This weakness for shaking hands,&rdquo; said young Morton, dusting his gloved
      fingers fastidiously, &ldquo;this weakness for shaking hands on the part of
      these common people is inexcusable. Still, on the whole, I did not think
      it a best occasion for administering a rebuke, don't y' know, and so
      allowed that low fellow his way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dave's all right,&rdquo; returned Big Kennedy. Then coming around to me: &ldquo;Now
      let's get down to business. You understand how the charge is murder, an'
      that no bail goes. But keep a stiff upper lip. The Chief is out to put a
      crimp in you, but we'll beat him just th' same. For every witness he
      brings, we'll bring two. Do you know who it was croaked th' Blacksmith?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I told him of the Sicilian; and how I had recognized the knife as I drew
      it from the throat of the dead man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's a cinch he threw it,&rdquo; said Big Kennedy; &ldquo;he was in the crowd an' saw
      you mixin' it up with th' Blacksmith, an' let him have it. Them Dagoes are
      great knife throwers. Did you get a flash of him in the crowd?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;there was no sign of him. I haven't told this story to
      anybody. We ought to give him time to take care of himself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Right you are,&rdquo; said Big Kennedy approvingly. &ldquo;He probably jumped aboard
      his boat; it's even money he's outside the Hook, out'ard bound, by now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then Big Kennedy discussed the case. I would be indicted and tried; there
      was no doubt of that. The Chief, our enemy, had possession of the court
      machinery; so far as indictment and trial were concerned he would not fail
      of his will.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An' it's th' judge in partic'lar, I'm leary of,&rdquo; said Big Kennedy
      thoughtfully. &ldquo;The Chief has got that jurist in hock to him, d'ye see! But
      there's another end to it; I've got a pull with the party who selects the
      jury, an' it'll be funny if we don't have half of 'em our way. That's
      right; th' worst they can hand us is a hung jury. If it takes money, now,&rdquo;
       and here Big Kennedy rolled a tentative eye on young Morton, &ldquo;if it should
      take money, I s'ppose we know where to look for it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Young Morton had been listening to every word, and for the moment, nothing
      about him of his usual languor. Beyond tapping his white teeth with the
      handle of his dress cane, he retained no trace of those affectations. I
      had much hope from the alert earnestness of young Morton, for I could tell
      that he would stay by my fortunes to the end.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What was that?&rdquo; he asked, when Big Kennedy spoke of money.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I said that if we have to buy any little thing like a juror or a witness,
      we know where to go for the money.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly!&rdquo; he lisped, relapsing into the exquisite; &ldquo;we shall buy the
      courthouse should the purchase of that edifice become necessary to our
      friend's security.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aint he a dandy!&rdquo; exclaimed Big Kennedy, surveying young Morton in a rapt
      way. Then coming back to me: &ldquo;I've got some news for you that you want to
      keep under your waistcoat. You know Billy Cassidy&mdash;Foxy Billy&mdash;him
      that studied to be a priest? You remember how I got him a post in th'
      Comptroller's office. Well, I sent for him not an hour ago; he's goin' to
      take copies of th' accounts that show what th' Chief an' them other
      highbinders at the top o' Tammany have been doin'. I'll have the papers on
      'em in less'n a week. If we get our hooks on what I'm after, an' Foxy
      Billy says we shall, we'll wipe that gang off th' earth.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Given those documents, we shall, as you say, obliterate them,&rdquo; chimed in
      young Morton. &ldquo;But speaking of your agent: Is this Foxy Billy as astute as
      his name would imply?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He could go down to Coney Island an' beat th' shells,&rdquo; said Big Kennedy
      confidently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;About the knife which gave James the Horseshoer his death wound,&rdquo; said
      young Morton. His tones were vapid, but his glance was bright enough.
      &ldquo;They've sent it to the Central Office. The detectives are sure to
      discover the pawnbroker who sold it. I think it would be wise, therefore,
      to carry the detectives the word ourselves. It will draw the sting out of
      that wasp; it would, really. It wouldn't look well to a jury, should we
      let them track down-this information, while it will destroy its effect if
      we ourselves tell them. I think with the start he has, we can trust that
      Sicilian individual to take care of himself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This suggestion appealed to Big Kennedy as good. He thought, too, that he
      and young Morton might better set about the matter without delay.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't lose your nerve,&rdquo; said he, shaking me by the hand. &ldquo;You are as safe
      as though you were in church. I'll crowd 'em, too, an' get this trial over
      inside of six weeks. By that time, if Foxy Billy is any good, we'll be
      ready to give the Chief some law business of his own.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One thing,&rdquo; I said at parting; &ldquo;my wife must not come here. I wouldn't
      have her see me in a cell to save my life.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      From the moment of my arrival at the Tombs, I had not ceased to think of
      Apple Cheek and her distress. Anne would do her best to comfort her; and
      for the rest&mdash;why! it must be borne. But I could not abide her seeing
      me a prisoner; not for her sake, but for my own.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, good-by!&rdquo; said young Morton, as he and Big Kennedy were taking
      themselves away. &ldquo;You need give yourself no uneasiness. Remember, you are
      not only right, but rich; and when, pray, was the right, on being backed
      by riches, ever beaten down?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Or for that matter, the wrong either?&rdquo; put in Big Kennedy sagely. &ldquo;I've
      never seen money lose a fight.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Our friend,&rdquo; said young Morton, addressing the warden, who had now
      returned, and speaking in a high superior vein, &ldquo;is to have everything he
      wants. Here is my card. Remember, now, this gentleman is my friend; and it
      is not to my fancy, don't y' know, that a friend of mine should lack for
      anything; it isn't, really!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As Big Kennedy and young Morton reached the door, I bethought me for the
      first time to ask the result of the election.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Was your father successful?&rdquo; I queried. &ldquo;These other matters quite drove
      the election from my head.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes,&rdquo; drawled young Morton, &ldquo;my father triumphed. I forget the phrase
      in which Mr. Kennedy described the method of his success, but it was
      highly epigrammatic and appropriate. How was it you said the old gentleman
      won?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I said that he won in a walk,&rdquo; returned Big Kennedy. Then, suspiciously:
      &ldquo;Say you aint guying me, be you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Me guy you?&rdquo; repeated young Morton, elevating his brows. &ldquo;I'd as soon
      think of deriding a king with crown and scepter!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      My trial came on within a month. Big Kennedy had a genius for expedition,
      and could hurry both men and events whenever it suited his inclinations.
      When I went to the bar I was accompanied by two of the leaders of the
      local guild of lawyers. These were my counsel, and they would leave no
      stone unturned to see me free. Big Kennedy sat by my side when the jury
      was empaneled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We've got eight of 'em painted,&rdquo; he whispered. &ldquo;I'd have had all twelve,&rdquo;
       he continued regretfully, &ldquo;but what with the challengin', an' what with
      some of 'em not knowin' enough, an' some of 'em knowin' too much, I lose
      four. However, eight ought to land us on our feet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There were no Irishmen in the panel, and I commented on the fact as
      strange.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I barred th' Irish,&rdquo; said Big Kennedy. &ldquo;Th' Irish are all right; I'm
      second-crop Irish&mdash;bein' born in this country&mdash;myself. But you
      don't never want one on a jury, especially on a charge of murder. There's
      this thing about a Mick: he'll cry an' sympathize with you an' shake your
      hand, an' send you flowers; but just th' same he always wants you hanged.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As Big Kennedy had apprehended, the Judge on the bench was set hard and
      chill as Arctic ice against me; I could read it in his jadestone eye. He
      would do his utmost to put a halter about my neck, and the look he
      bestowed upon me, menacing and full of doom, made me feel lost and
      gallows-ripe indeed. Suppose they should hang me! I had seen Sheeny Joe
      dispatched for Sing Sing from that very room! The memory of it, with the
      Judge lowering from the bench like a death-threat, sent a cold thought to
      creep and coil about my heart and crush it as in the folds of a snake.
    </p>
    <p>
      There came the pawnbroker to swear how he sold me the knife those years
      ago. The prosecution insisted as an inference drawn from this, that the
      knife was mine. Then a round dozen stood up to tell of my rush upon Jimmy
      the Blacksmith; and how he fell; and how, a moment later, I fronted them
      with the red knife in my clutch and the dead man weltering where he went
      down. Some there were who tried to say they saw me strike the blow.
    </p>
    <p>
      While this evidence was piling up, ever and again some timid juryman would
      glance towards Big Kennedy inquiringly. The latter would send back an
      ocular volley of threats that meant death or exile should that juror
      flinch or fail him.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the State ended, a score of witnesses took the stand in my behalf.
      One and all, having been tutored by Big Kennedy, they told of the thrown
      knife which came singing through the air like a huge hornet from the far
      outskirts of the crowd. Many had not seen the hand that hurled the knife;
      a few had been more fortunate, and described him faithfully as a small
      lean man, dark, a red silk cloth over his head, and earrings dangling from
      his ears.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He was a sailorman, too,&rdquo; said one, more graphic than the rest; &ldquo;as I
      could tell by the tar on his hands an' a ship tattooed on th' back of one
      of 'em. He stood right by me when he flung the knife.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why didn't you seize him?&rdquo; questioned the State's Attorney, with a
      half-sneer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not on your life!&rdquo; said the witness. &ldquo;I aint collarin' nobody; I don't
      get policeman's wages.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Judge gave his instructions to the jury, and I may say he did his
      best, or worst, to drag me to the scaffold. The jurors listened; but they
      owned eyes as well as ears, and for every word spoken by the Judge's
      tongue, Big Kennedy's eyes spoke two. Also, there was that faultless
      exquisite, young Morton, close and familiar to my side. The dullest ox-wit
      of that panel might tell how I was belted about by strong influences, and
      ones that could work a vengeance. Wherefore, when the jury at last
      retired, there went not one whose mind was not made up, and no more than
      twenty minutes ran by before the foreman's rap on the door announced them
      as prepared to give decision. They filed soberly in. The clerk read the
      verdict.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not guilty!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Judge's face was like thunder; he gulped and glared, and then
      demanded:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is this your verdict?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is,&rdquo; returned the foreman, standing in his place; and his eleven
      fellow jurors, two of whom belonged to my Red Jackets, nodded assent.
    </p>
    <p>
      Home I went on wings. Anne met me in the hallway and welcomed me with a
      kiss. She wore a strange look, but in my hurry for Apple Cheek I took no
      particular heed of that.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where is she&mdash;where is my wife?&rdquo; said I.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then a blackcoat man came from the rear room; he looked the doctor and had
      the smell of drugs about him. Anne glanced at him questioningly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think he may come in,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;But make no noise! Don't excite her!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Apple Cheek, who was Apple Cheek no longer with her face hollowed and
      white, was lying in the bed. Her eyes were big and bright, and the ghost
      of a smile parted her wan lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm so happy!&rdquo; she whispered, voice hardly above a breath. Then with weak
      hands she drew me down to her. &ldquo;I've prayed and prayed, and I knew it
      would come right,&rdquo; she murmured.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then Anne, who had followed me to the bedside, drew away the coverings. It
      was like a revelation, for I had been told no word of it, nor so much as
      dreamed of such sweet chances. The dear surprise of it was in one sense
      like a blow, and I staggered on my feet as that day's threats had owned no
      power to make me. There, with little face upturned and sleeping, was a
      babe!&mdash;our babe!
    </p>
    <p>
      &mdash;Apple Cheek's and mine!&mdash;our baby girl that had been born to
      us while its father lay in jail on a charge of murder! While I looked, it
      opened its eyes; and then a wailing, quivering cry went up that swept
      across my soul like a tune of music.

      CHAPTER XII&mdash;DARBY THE GOPHER
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">F</span>OXY BILLY CASSIDY
      made but slow work of obtaining those papers asked for to overthrow our
      enemy, the Chief. He copied reams upon reams of contracts and vouchers and
      accounts, but those to wholly match the crushing purposes of Big Kennedy
      were not within his touch. The documents which would set the public ablaze
      were held in a safe, of which none save one most trusted by the Chief, and
      deep in both his plans and their perils, possessed the secret.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's how the game stands,&rdquo; explained Big Kennedy. &ldquo;Foxy Billy's up
      ag'inst it. The cards we need are in th' safe, an' Billy aint got th'
      combination, d'ye see.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can anything be done with the one who has?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothin',&rdquo; replied Big Kennedy. &ldquo;No, there's no gettin' next to th' party
      with th' combination. Billy did try to stand in with this duck; an' say!
      he turned sore in a second.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you've no hope?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not exactly that,&rdquo; returned Big Kennedy, as though revolving some
      proposal in his mind. &ldquo;I'll hit on a way. When it comes to a finish, I
      don't think there's a safe in New York I couldn't turn inside out. But
      I've got to have time to think.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There existed strong argument for exertion on Big Kennedy's part. Both he
      and I were fighting literally for liberty and for life. Our sole hope of
      safety layin the overthrow of the Chief; we must destroy or be destroyed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Big Kennedy was alive to the situation. He said as much when, following
      that verdict of &ldquo;Not guilty!&rdquo; I thanked him as one who had worked most for
      my defense.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There's no thanks comin',&rdquo; said Big Kennedy, in his bluff way. &ldquo;I had to
      break th' Chief of that judge-an'-jury habit at th' go-off. He'd have
      nailed me next.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Big Kennedy and I, so to phrase it, were as prisoners of politics. Our
      feud with the Chief, as the days went by, widened to open war. Its
      political effect was to confine us to our own territory, and we undertook
      no enterprise which ran beyond our proper boundaries. It was as though our
      ward were a walled town. Outside all was peril; inside we were secure.
      Against the Chief and the utmost of his power, we could keep our own, and
      did. His word lost force when once it crossed our frontiers; his mandates
      fell to the ground.
    </p>
    <p>
      Still, while I have described ourselves as ones in a kind of captivity, we
      lived sumptuously enough on our small domain. Big Kennedy went about the
      farming of his narrow acres with an agriculture deeper than ever. No
      enterprise that either invaded or found root in our region was permitted
      to go free, but one and all paid tribute. From street railways to push
      carts, from wholesale stores to hand-organs, they must meet our levy or
      see their interests pine. And thus we thrived.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, for all the rich fatness of our fortunes, Big Kennedy's designs
      against the Chief never cooled. On our enemy's side, we had daily proof
      that he, in his planning, was equally sleepless. If it had not been for my
      seat in the Board of Aldermen, and our local rule of the police which was
      its corollary, the machine might have broken us down. As it was, we
      sustained ourselves, and the sun shone for our ward haymaking, if good
      weather went with us no farther.
    </p>
    <p>
      One afternoon Big Kennedy of the suddenest broke upon me with an
      exclamation of triumph.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have it!&rdquo; he cried; &ldquo;I know the party who will show us every paper in
      that safe.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who is he?&rdquo; said I.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll bring him to you to-morrow night. He's got a country place up th'
      river, an' never leaves it. He hasn't been out of th' house for almost
      five years, but I think I can get him to come.&rdquo; Big Kennedy looked as
      though the situation concealed a jest. &ldquo;But I can't stand here talkin';
      I've got to scatter for th' Grand Central.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Who should this gifted individual be? Who was he who could come in from a
      country house, which he had not quitted for five years, and hand us those
      private papers now locked, and fast asleep, within the Comptroller's safe?
      The situation was becoming mysterious, and my patience would be on a
      stretch until the mystery was laid bare. The sure enthusiasm of Big
      Kennedy gave an impression of comfort. Big Kennedy was no hare-brained
      optimist, nor one to count his chickens before they were hatched.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Big Kennedy came into the sanctum on the following evening, the grasp
      he gave me was the grasp of victory.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's all over but th' yellin'!&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;we've got them papers in a
      corner.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Big Kennedy presented me to a shy, retiring person, who bore him company,
      and who took my hand reluctantly. He was not ill-looking, this stranger;
      but he had a furtive roving eye&mdash;the eye of a trapped animal. His
      skin, too, was of a yellow, pasty color, like bad piecrust, and there
      abode a damp, chill atmosphere about him that smelled of caves and
      caverns.
    </p>
    <p>
      After I greeted him, he walked away in a manner strangely unsocial, and,
      finding a chair, sate himself down in a corner. He acted as might one
      detained against his will and who was not the master of himself. Also,
      there was something professional in it all, as though the purpose of his
      presence were one of business. I mentioned in a whisper the queer
      sallowness of the stranger.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sure!&rdquo; said Big Kennedy. &ldquo;It's th' prison pallor on him. I've got to let
      him lay dead for a week or ten days to give him time to cover it with a
      beard, as well as show a better haircut.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who is he?&rdquo; I demanded, my amazement beginning to sit up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He's a gopher,&rdquo; returned Big Kennedy, surveying the stranger with
      victorious complacency. &ldquo;Yes, indeed; he can go through a safe like th'
      grace of heaven through a prayer meetin'.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is he a burglar?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Burglar? No!&rdquo; retorted Big Kennedy disgustedly; &ldquo;he's an artist. Any hobo
      could go in with drills an' spreaders an' pullers an' wedges, an' crack a
      box. But this party does it by ear; just sits down before a safe, an'
      fumbles an' fools with it ten minutes, an' swings her open. I tell you
      he's a wonder! He knows th' insides of a safe like a priest knows th'
      insides of a prayer-book.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where was he?&rdquo; I asked. &ldquo;Where did you pick him up?&rdquo; and here I took a
      second survey of the talented stranger, who dropped his eyes on the floor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Pen,&rdquo; said Big Kennedy. &ldquo;The warden an' me are old side-partners, an'
      I borrowed him. I knew where he was, d'ye see! He's doin' a stretch of
      five years for a drop-trick he turned in an Albany bank. That's what comes
      of goin' outside your specialty; he'd ought to have stuck to safes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aren't you afraid he'll run?&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;You can't watch him night and day,
      and he'll give you the slip.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No fear of his side-steppin',&rdquo; replied Big Kennedy confidently. &ldquo;He's
      only got six weeks more to go, an' it wouldn't pay to slip his collar for
      a little pinch of time like that. Besides, I've promised him five hundred
      dollars for this job, an' left it in th' warden's hands.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What's his name?&rdquo; I inquired.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Darby the Goph.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Big Kennedy now unfolded his plan for making Darby the Goph useful in our
      affairs. Foxy Billy would allow himself to get behind in his labors over
      the City books. In a spasm of industry he would arrange with his superiors
      to work nights until he was again abreast of his duties. Foxy Billy, night
      after night, would thus be left alone in the Comptroller's office. The
      safe that baffled us for those priceless documents would be unguarded.
      Nothing would be thought by janitors and night watchmen of the presence of
      Darby the Goph. He would be with Foxy Billy in the rôle of a friend, who
      meant no more than to kindly cheer his lonely labors.
    </p>
    <p>
      Darby the Goph would lounge and kill time while Foxy Billy moiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There's the scheme to put Darby inside,&rdquo; said Big Kennedy in conclusion.
      &ldquo;Once they're alone, he'll tear th' packin' out o' that safe. When Billy
      has copied the papers, th' game's as simple as suckin' eggs. We'll spring
      'em, an' make th' Chief look like a dress suit at a gasfitters' ball.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Big Kennedy's programme was worked from beginning to end by Foxy Billy and
      Darby the Goph, and never jar nor jolt nor any least of friction. It ran
      out as smoothly as two and two make four. In the end, Big Kennedy held in
      his fingers every evidence required to uproot the Chief. The ear and the
      hand of Darby the Goph had in no sort lost their cunning.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An' now,&rdquo; said Big Kennedy, when dismissing Darby the Goph, &ldquo;you go back
      where you belong. I've wired the warden, an' he'll give you that bit of
      dough. I've sent for a copper to put you on th' train. I don't want to
      take chances on you stayin' over a day. You might get to lushin', an'
      disgrace yourself with th' warden.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The police officer arrived, and Big Kennedy told him to see Darby the Goph
      aboard the train.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't make no mistake,&rdquo; said Big Kennedy, by way of warning. &ldquo;He belongs
      in Sing Sing, an' must get back without fail to-night. Stay by th' train
      till it pulls out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How about th' bristles?&rdquo; said the officer, pointing to the two-weeks'
      growth of beard that stubbled the chin of the visitor. &ldquo;Shall I have him
      scraped?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, they'll fix his face up there,&rdquo; said Big Kennedy. &ldquo;The warden don't
      care what he looks like, only so he gets his clamps on him ag'in.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here's the documents,&rdquo; said Big Kennedy, when Darby the Goph and his
      escort had departed. &ldquo;The question now is, how to give th' Chief th' gaff,
      an' gaff him deep an' good. He's th' party who was goin' to leave me on
      both sides of th' street.&rdquo; This last with an exultant sneer.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was on my thoughts that the hand to hurl the thunderbolt we had been
      forging was that of the reputable old gentleman. The blow would fall more
      smitingly if dealt by him; his was a name superior for this duty to either
      Big Kennedy's or my own. With this argument, Big Kennedy declared himself
      in full accord.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It'll look more like th' real thing,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;to have th' kick come
      from th' outside. Besides, if I went to th' fore it might get in my way
      hereafter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The reputable old gentleman moved with becoming conservatism, not to say
      dignity. He took the documents furnished by the ingenuity of Darby the
      Goph, and the oil-burning industry of Foxy Billy, and pored over them for
      a day. Then he sent for Big Kennedy. &ldquo;The evidence you furnish me,&rdquo; said
      he, &ldquo;seems absolutely conclusive. It betrays a corruption not paralleled
      in modern times, with the head of Tammany as the hub of the villainy. The
      town has been plundered of millions,&rdquo; concluded the reputable old
      gentleman, with a fine oratorical flourish, &ldquo;and it is my duty to lay bare
      this crime in all its enormity, as one of the people's Representatives.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An' a taxpayer,&rdquo; added Big Kennedy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sir, my duty as a Representative,&rdquo; returned the reputable old gentleman
      severely, &ldquo;has precedence over my privileges as a taxpayer.&rdquo; Then, as
      though the question offered difficulties: &ldquo;The first step should be the
      publication of these documents in a paper of repute.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The reputable old gentleman had grounds for hesitation. Our enemy, the
      Chief, was not without his allies among the dailies of that hour. The
      Chief was popular in certain glutton circles. He still held to those
      characteristics of a ready, laughing, generous recklessness that marked
      him in a younger day when, as head of a fire company, with trousers tucked
      in boots, red shirt, fire helmet, and white coat thrown over arm, he led
      the ropes and cheered his men. But what were excellent as traits in a
      fireman, became fatal under conditions where secrecy and a policy of no
      noise were required for his safety. He was headlong, careless; and,
      indifferent to discovery since he believed himself secure, the trail of
      his wrongdoing was as widely obvious, not to say as unclean, as was
      Broadway.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said the reputable old gentleman, &ldquo;the great thing is to pitch upon
      a proper paper.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There's the <i>Dally Tory?</i>&rdquo; suggested Big Kennedy. &ldquo;It's a very
      honest sheet,&rdquo; said the reputable old gentleman approvingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Also,&rdquo; said Big Kennedy, &ldquo;the Chief has just cut it out of th' City
      advertisin', d'ye see, an' it's as warm as a wolf.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      For these double reasons of probity and wrath, the <i>Daily Tory</i> was
      agreed to. The reputable old gentleman would put himself in touch with the
      <i>Daily Tory</i> without delay.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who is this Chief of Tammany?&rdquo; asked the reputable old gentleman, towards
      the close of the conference. &ldquo;Personally, I know but little about him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He'd be all right,&rdquo; said Big Kennedy, &ldquo;but he was spoiled in the bringin'
      up. He was raised with th' fire companies, an' he made th' mistake of
      luggin' his speakin' trumpet into politics.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But is he a deep, forceful man?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; returned Big Kennedy, with a contemptuous toss of the hand. &ldquo;If he
      was, you wouldn't have been elected to Congress. He makes a brash
      appearance, but there's nothin' behind. You open his front door an' you're
      in his back yard.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The reputable old gentleman was bowing us out of his library, when Big
      Kennedy gave him a parting word.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now remember: my name aint to show at all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But the honor!&rdquo; exclaimed the reputable old gentleman. &ldquo;The honor of this
      mighty reform will be rightfully yours. You ought to have it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'd rather have Tammany Hall,&rdquo; responded Big Kennedy with a laugh, &ldquo;an'
      if I get to be too much of a reformer it might queer me. No, you go in an'
      do up th' Chief. When he's rubbed out, I intend to be Chief in his place.
      I'd rather be Chief than have th' honor you tell of. There's more money in
      it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you prefer money to honor?&rdquo; returned the reputable old gentleman,
      somewhat scandalized.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll take th' money for mine, every time,&rdquo; responded Big Kennedy. &ldquo;Honor
      ought to have a bank account. The man who hasn't anything but honor gets
      pitied when he doesn't get laughed at, an' for my part I'm out for th'
      dust.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Four days later the <i>Daily Tory</i> published the first of its articles;
      it fell upon our enemy with the force of a trip-hammer. From that hour the
      assaults on the Chief gained never let or stay. The battle staggered on
      for months. The public, hating him for his insolence, joined in hunting
      him. One by one those papers, so lately his adorers, showed him their
      backs.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Papers sail only with the wind,&rdquo; said Big Kennedy sagely, in commenting
      on these ink-desertions of the Chief.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the midst of the trouble, Old Mike began to sicken for his end. He was
      dying of old age, and the stream of his life went sinking into his years
      like water into sand. Big Kennedy gave up politics to sit by the bedside
      of the dying old man. One day Old Mike seemed greatly to revive.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jawn,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;you'll be th' Chief of Tammany. The Chief, now fightin'
      for his life, will lose. The mish-take he made was in robbin' honest
      people. Jawn, he should have robbed th' crim'nals an' th' law breakers.
      The rogues can't fight back, an' th' honest people can. An' remember this:
      the public don't care for what it hears, only for what it sees. Never
      interfere with people's beer; give 'em clean streets; double the number of
      lamp-posts&mdash;th' public's like a fly, it's crazy over lamps&mdash;an'
      have bands playin' in every par-rk. Then kape th' streets free of ba-ad
      people, tinhorn min, an' such. You don't have to drive 'em out o' town,
      only off th' streets; th' public don't object to dirt, but it wants it
      kept in the back alleys. Jawn, if you'll follow what I tell you, you can
      do what else ye plaze. The public will go with ye loike a drunkard to th'
      openin' of a new s'loon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What you must do, father,&rdquo; said Big Kennedy cheerfully, &ldquo;is get well, an'
      see that I run things straight.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jawn,&rdquo; returned Old Mike, smiling faintly, &ldquo;this is Choosday; by Saturday
      night I'll be dead an' under th' daisies.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Old Mike's funeral was a creeping, snail-like, reluctant thing of miles,
      with woe-breathing bands to mark the sorrowful march. Big Kennedy never
      forgot; and to the last of his power, the question uppermost in his mind,
      though never in his mouth, was whether or not that one who sought his
      favor had followed Old Mike to the grave.
    </p>
    <p>
      The day of Old Mike's funeral saw the destruction of our enemy, the Chief.
      He fell with the crash of a tree. He fled, a hunted thing, and was brought
      back to perish in a prison. And so came the end of him, by the wit of Big
      Kennedy and the furtive sleighty genius of Darby the Goph.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XIII&mdash;BIG KENNEDY AND THE MUGWUMPS
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">W</span>HEN the old Chief
      was gone, Big Kennedy succeeded to his place as the ruling spirit of the
      organization. For myself, I moved upward to become a figure of power only
      a whit less imposing; for I stepped forth as a leader of the ward, while
      in the general councils of Tammany I was recognized as Big Kennedy's
      adviser and lieutenant.
    </p>
    <p>
      To the outside eye, unskilled of politics in practice, everything of
      Tammany sort would have seemed in the plight desperate. The efforts
      required for the overthrow of the old Chief, and Big Kennedy's bolt in
      favor of the forces of reform&mdash;ever the blood enemy of Tammany&mdash;had
      torn the organization to fragments. A first result of this dismemberment
      was the formation of a rival organization meant to dominate the local
      Democracy. This rival coterie was not without its reasons of strength,
      since it was upheld as much as might be by the State machine. The
      situation was one which for a time would compel Big Kennedy to tolerate
      the company of his reform friends, and affect, even though he privately
      opposed them, some appearance of sympathy with their plans for the
      purification of the town.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But,&rdquo; observed Big Kennedy, when we considered the business between
      ourselves, &ldquo;I think I can set these guys by the ears. There aint a man in
      New York who, directly or round th' corner, aint makin' money through a
      broken law, an' these mugwumps aint any exception. I've invited three
      members of the main squeeze to see me, an' I'll make a side bet they get
      tired before I do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In deference to the invitation of Big Kennedy, there came to call upon him
      a trio of civic excellence, each a personage of place. Leading the three
      was our longtime friend, the reputable old gentleman. Of the others, one
      was a personage whose many millions were invested in real estate, the
      rentals whereof ran into the hundreds of thousands, while his companion
      throve as a wholesale grocer, a feature of whose business was a rich trade
      in strong drink.
    </p>
    <p>
      Big Kennedy met the triumvirate with brows of sanctimony, and was a moral
      match for the purest. When mutual congratulations over virtue's late
      successes at the ballot box, and the consequent dawn of whiter days for
      the town, were ended, Big Kennedy, whose statecraft was of the blunt,
      positive kind, brought to the discussional center the purpose of the
      meeting.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We're not only goin' to clean up th' town, gents,&rdquo; said Big Kennedy
      unctuously, &ldquo;but Tammany Hall as well. There's to be no more corruption;
      no more blackmail; every man an' every act must show as clean as a dog's
      tooth. I s'ppose, now, since we've got th' mayor, th' alderman, an' th'
      police, our first duty is to jump in an' straighten up th' village?&rdquo; Here
      Big Kennedy scanned the others with a virtuous eye.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Precisely,&rdquo; observed the reputable old gentleman. &ldquo;And since the most
      glaring evils ought to claim our earliest attention, we should compel the
      police, without delay, to go about the elimination of the disorderly
      elements&mdash;the gambling dens, and other vice sinks. What do you say,
      Goldnose?&rdquo; and the reputable old gentleman turned with a quick air to him
      of the giant rent-rolls.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now on those points,&rdquo; responded the personage of real estate dubiously,
      &ldquo;I should say that we ought to proceed slowly. You can't rid the community
      of vice; history shows it to be impossible.&rdquo; Then, with a look of cunning
      meaning: &ldquo;There exist, however, evils not morally bad, perhaps, that after
      all are violations of law, and get much more in the way of citizens than
      gambling or any of its sister iniquities.&rdquo; Then, wheeling spitefully on
      the reputable old gentleman: &ldquo;There's the sidewalk and street ordinances:
      You know the European Express Company, Morton? I understand that you are a
      heaviest stockholder in it. I went by that corner the other day and I
      couldn't get through for the jam of horses and trucks that choked the
      street. There they stood, sixty horses, thirty trucks, and the side street
      fairly impassable. I scratched one side of my brougham to the point of
      ruin&mdash;scratched off my coat-of-arms, in fact, on the pole of one of
      the trucks. I think that to enforce the laws meant to keep the street free
      of obstructions is more important, as a civic reform, than driving out
      gamblers. These latter people, after all, get in nobody's way, and if one
      would find them one must hunt for them. They are prompt with their rents,
      too, and ready to pay a highest figure; they may be reckoned among the
      best tenants to be found.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The real estate personage was red in the face when he had finished this
      harangue. He wiped his brow and looked resentfully at the reputable old
      gentleman. That latter purist was now in a state of great personal heat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Those sixty horses were being fed, sir,&rdquo; said he with spirit. &ldquo;The barn
      is more than a mile distant; there's no time to go there and back during
      the noon hour. You can't have the barn on Broadway, you know. That would
      be against the law, even if the value of Broadway property didn't put it
      out of reach.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Still, it's against the law to obstruct the streets,&rdquo; declared the
      real-estate personage savagely, &ldquo;just as much as it is against the law to
      gamble. And the trucks and teams are more of a public nuisance, sir!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose,&rdquo; responded the reputable old gentleman, with a sneer, &ldquo;that if
      my express horses paid somebody a double rent, paid it to you, Goldnose,
      for instance, they wouldn't be so much in the way.&rdquo; Then, as one
      exasperated to frankness: &ldquo;Why don't you come squarely out like a man, and
      say that to drive the disorderly characters from the town would drive a
      cipher or two off your rents?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I, or any other real-estate owner,&rdquo; responded the baited one
      indignantly, &ldquo;rent certain tenements, not otherwise to be let, to
      disorderly characters, whose fault is it? I can't control the town for
      either its morals or its business. The town grows up about my property,
      and conditions are made to occur that practically condemn it. Good people
      won't live there, and the property is unfit for stores or warehouses. What
      is an owner to do? The neighborhood becomes such that best people won't
      make of it a spot of residence. It's either no rent, or a tenant who lives
      somewhat in the shade. Real-estate owners, I suppose, are to be left with
      millions of unrentable property on their hands; but you, on your side, are
      not to lose half an hour in taking your horses to a place where they might
      lawfully be fed? What do you say, Casebottle?&rdquo; and the outraged
      real-estate prince turned to the wholesale grocer, as though seeking an
      ally.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm inclined, friend Goldnose,&rdquo; returned the wholesale grocer suavely,
      &ldquo;I'm inclined to think with you that it will be difficult to deal with the
      town as though it were a camp meeting. Puritanism is offensive to the
      urban taste.&rdquo; Here the wholesale grocer cleared his throat impressively.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And so,&rdquo; cried the reputable old gentleman, &ldquo;you call the suppression of
      gamblers and base women, puritanism? Casebottle, I'm surprised!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The wholesale grocer looked nettled, but held his peace. There came a
      moment of silence. Big Kennedy, who had listened without interference,
      maintaining the while an inflexible morality, took advantage of the pause.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One thing,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;about which I think you will all agree, is that
      every ginmill open after hours, or on Sunday, should be pinched, and no
      side-doors or speakeasy racket stood for. We can seal th' town up as tight
      as sardines.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Big Kennedy glanced shrewdly at Casebottle. Here was a move that would
      injure wholesale whisky. Casebottle, however, did not immediately respond;
      it was the reputable old gentleman who spoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's my notion,&rdquo; said he, pursing his lips. &ldquo;Every ginmill ought to be
      closed as tight as a drum. The Sabbath should be kept free of that
      disorder which rum-drinking is certain to breed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, then,&rdquo; broke in Casebottle, whose face began to color as his
      interests began to throb, &ldquo;I say that a saloon is a poor man's club. If
      you're going to close the saloons, I shall be in favor of shutting up the
      clubs. I don't believe in one law for the poor and another for the rich.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This should offer some impression of how the visitors agreed upon a civil
      policy. Big Kennedy was good enough to offer for the others, each of whom
      felt himself somewhat caught in a trap, a loophole of escape.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For,&rdquo; explained Big Kennedy, &ldquo;while I believe in rigidly enforcin' every
      law until it is repealed, I have always held that a law can be tacitly
      repealed by th' people, without waitin' for th' action of some skate
      legislature, who, comin' for th' most part from th' cornfields, has got it
      in for us lucky ducks who live in th' town. To put it this way: If there's
      a Sunday closin' law, or a law ag'inst gamblers, or a law ag'inst
      obstructin' th' streets, an' th' public don't want it enforced, then I
      hold it's repealed by th' highest authority in th' land, which is th'
      people, d'ye see!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, I think that very well put,&rdquo; replied the real-estate personage, with
      a sigh of relief, while the wholesale grocer nodded approval. &ldquo;I think
      that very well put,&rdquo; he went on, &ldquo;and as it's getting late, I suggest that
      we adjourn for the nonce, to meet with our friend, Mr. Kennedy, on some
      further occasion. For myself, I can see that he and the great organization
      of which he is now, happily, the head, are heartily with us for reforming
      the shocking conditions that have heretofore persisted in this community.
      We have won the election; as a corollary, peculation and blackmail and
      extortion will of necessity cease. I think, with the utmost safety to the
      public interest, we can leave matters to take their natural course,
      without pushing to extremes. Don't you think so, Mr. Kennedy?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sure!&rdquo; returned that chieftain. &ldquo;There's always more danger in too much
      steam than in too little.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The reputable old gentleman was by no means in accord with the real-estate
      personage; but since the wholesale grocer cast in his voice for moderation
      and no extremes, he found himself in a hopeless minority of no one save
      himself. With an eye of high contempt, therefore, for what he described as
      &ldquo;The reform that needs reform,&rdquo; he went away with the others, and the
      weighty convention for pure days was over.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An' that's th' last we'll see of 'em,&rdquo; said Big Kennedy, with a laugh.
      &ldquo;No cat enjoys havin' his own tail shut in th' door; no man likes th'
      reform that pulls a gun on his partic'lar interest. This whole reform
      racket,&rdquo; continued Big Kennedy, who was in a temper to moralize, &ldquo;is, to
      my thinkin', a kind of pouter-pigeon play. Most of 'em who go in for it
      simply want to swell 'round. Besides the pouter-pigeon, who's in th' game
      because he's stuck on himself, there's only two breeds of reformers. One
      is a Republican who's got ashamed of himself; an' th' other is some crook
      who's been kicked out o' Tammany for graftin' without a license.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Would your last include you and me?&rdquo; I asked. I thought I might hazard a
      small jest, since we were now alone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It might,&rdquo; returned Big Kennedy, with an iron grin. Then, twisting the
      subject: &ldquo;Now let's talk serious for two words. I've been doin' th' bunco
      act so long with our three friends that my face begins to ache with
      lookin' pious. Now listen: You an' me have got a long road ahead of us,
      an' money to be picked up on both sides. But let me break this off to you,
      an' don't let a word get away. When you do get th' stuff, don't go to
      buildin' brownstone fronts, an' buyin' trottin' horses, an' givin'
      yourself away with any Coal-Oil Johnny capers. If we were Republicans or
      mugwumps it might do. But let a Democrat get a dollar, an' there's a
      warrant out for him before night. When you get a wad, bury it like a dog
      does a bone. An' speakin' of money; I've sent for th' Chief of Police..
      Come to think of it, we'd better talk over to my house. I'll go there now,
      an' you stay an' lay for him. When he shows up, bring him to me. There
      won't be so many pipin' us off over to my house.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Big Kennedy left the Tammany headquarters, where he and the good
      government trio had conferred, and sauntered away in the direction of his
      habitat. The Chief of Police did not keep me in suspense. Big Kennedy was
      not four blocks away when that blue functionary appeared.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm to go with you to his house,&rdquo; said I.
    </p>
    <p>
      The head of the police was a bloated porpoise-body of a man, oily,
      plausible, masking his cunning with an appearance of frankness. As for
      scruple; why then the sharks go more freighted of a conscience.
    </p>
    <p>
      Big Kennedy met the Chief of Police with the freedom that belongs with an
      acquaintance, boy and man, of forty years. In a moment they had gotten to
      the marrow of what was between them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; said Big Kennedy, &ldquo;Tammany's crippled just now with not
      havin' complete swing in th' town; an' I've got to bunk in more or less
      with the mugwumps. Still, we've th' upper hand in th' Board of Aldermen,
      an' are stronger everywhere than any other single party. Now you
      understand;&rdquo; and here Big Kennedy bent a keen eye on the other. &ldquo;Th'
      organization's in need of steady, monthly contributions. We'll want 'em in
      th' work I'm layin' out. I think you know where to get 'em, an' I leave it
      to you to organize th' graft. You get your bit, d'ye see! I'm goin' to
      name a party, however, to act as your wardman an' make th' collections.
      What sort is that McCue who was made Inspector about a week ago?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;McCue!&rdquo; returned the Chief of Police in tones of surprise. &ldquo;That man
      would never do! He's as honest as a clock!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Honest!&rdquo; exclaimed Big Kennedy, and his amazement was a picture. &ldquo;Well,
      what does he think he's doin' on th' force, then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's too many for me,&rdquo; replied the other. Then, apologetically: &ldquo;But
      you can see yourself, that when you rake together six thousand men, no
      matter how you pick 'em out, some of 'em's goin' to be honest.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; assented Big Kennedy thoughtfully, &ldquo;I s'ppose that's so, too. It
      would be askin' too much to expect that a force, as you say, of six
      thousand could be brought together, an' have 'em all crooked. It was
      Father Considine who mentioned this McCue; he said he was his cousin an'
      asked me to give him a shove along. It shows what I've claimed a dozen
      times, that th' Church ought to keep its nose out o' politics. However,
      I'll look over th' list, an' give you some good name to-morrow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But how about th' town?&rdquo; asked the Chief of Police anxiously. &ldquo;I want to
      know what I'm doin'. Tell me plain, just what goes an' what don't.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This for a pointer, then,&rdquo; responded Big Kennedy. &ldquo;Whatever goes has got
      to go on th' quiet. I've got to keep things smooth between me an' th'
      mugwumps. The gamblers can run; an' I don't find any fault with even th'
      green-goods people. None of 'em can beat a man who don't put himself
      within his reach, an' I don't protect suckers. But knucks, dips, sneaks,
      second-story people, an' strong-arm men have got to quit. That's straight;
      let a trick come off on th' street cars, or at th' theater, or in the
      dark, or let a crib get cracked, an' there'll be trouble between you an'
      me, d'ye see! An' if anything as big as a bank should get done up, why
      then, you send in your resignation. An' at that, you'll be dead lucky if
      you don't do time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There's th' stations an' th' ferries,&rdquo; said the other, with an
      insinuating leer. &ldquo;You know a mob of them Western fine-workers are likely
      to blow in on us, an' we not wise to 'em&mdash;not havin' their mugs in
      the gallery. That sort of knuck might do business at th' depots or
      ferries, an' we couldn't help ourselves. Anyway,&rdquo; he concluded hopefully,
      &ldquo;they seldom touch up our own citizens; it's mostly th' farmers they go
      through.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right,&rdquo; said Big Kennedy cheerfully, &ldquo;I'm not worryin' about what
      comes off with th' farmers. But you tell them fine-workers, whose mugs you
      haven't got, that if anyone who can vote or raise a row in New York City
      goes shy his watch or leather, th' artist who gets it can't come here
      ag'in. Now mind: You've got to keep this town so I can hang my watch on
      any lamp-post in it, an' go back in a week an' find it hasn't been
      touched. There'll be plenty of ways for me an' you to get rich without
      standin' for sneaks an' hold-ups.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Big Kennedy, so soon as he got possession of Tammany, began divers
      improvements of a political sort, and each looking to our safety and
      perpetuation. One of his moves was to break up the ward gangs, and this
      included the Tin Whistles.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For one thing, we don't need 'em&mdash;you an' me,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;They could
      only help us while we stayed in our ward an' kept in touch with 'em. The
      gangs strengthen th' ward leaders, but they don't strengthen th' Chief. So
      we're goin' to abolish 'em. The weaker we make th' ward leaders, the
      stronger we make ourselves. Do you ketch on?&rdquo; and Big Kennedy nudged me
      significantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You've got to disband, boys,&rdquo; said I, when I had called the Tin Whistles
      together. &ldquo;Throw away your whistles. Big Kennedy told me that the first
      toot on one of 'em would get the musician thirty days on the Island. It's
      an order; so don't bark your shins against it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      After Big Kennedy was installed as Chief, affairs in their currents for
      either Big Kennedy or myself went flowing never more prosperously. The
      town settled to its lines; and the Chief of Police, with a wardman whom
      Big Kennedy selected, and who was bitten by no defect of integrity like
      the dangerous McCue, was making monthly returns of funds collected for
      &ldquo;campaign purposes&rdquo; with which the most exacting could have found no
      fault. We were rich, Big Kennedy and I; and acting on that suggestion of
      concealment, neither was blowing a bugle over his good luck.
    </p>
    <p>
      I could have been happy, being now successful beyond any dream that my
      memory could lay hands on, had it not been for Apple Cheek and her waning
      health. She, poor girl, had never been the same after my trial for the
      death of Jimmy the Blacksmith; the shock of that trouble bore her down
      beyond recall. The doctors called it a nervous prostration, but I think,
      what with the fright and the grief of it, that the poor child broke her
      heart. She was like something broken; and although years went by she never
      once held up her head. Apple Cheek faded slowly away, and at last died in
      my arms.
    </p>
    <p>
      When she passed, and it fell upon me like a pall that Apple Cheek had gone
      from me forever, my very heart withered and perished within me. There was
      but one thing to live for: Blossom, my baby girl. Anne came to dwell with
      us to be a mother to her, and it was good for me what Anne did, and better
      still for little Blossom. I was no one to have Blossom's upbringing, being
      ignorant and rude, and unable to look upon her without my eyes filling up
      for thoughts of my lost Apple Cheek. That was a sharpest of griefs&mdash;the
      going of Apple Cheek! My one hope lay in forgetfulness, and I courted it
      by working at politics, daylight and dark.
    </p>
    <p>
      It would seem, too, that the blow that sped death to Apple Cheek had left
      its nervous marks on little Blossom. She was timid, hysterical,
      terror-whipped of fears that had no form. She would shriek out in the
      night as though a fiend frighted her, and yet could tell no story of it.
      She lived the victim of a vast formless fear that was to her as a demon
      without outlines or members or face. One blessing: I could give the
      trembling Blossom rest by holding her close in my arms, and thus she has
      slept the whole night through. The &ldquo;frights,&rdquo; she said, fled when I was
      by.
    </p>
    <p>
      In that hour, Anne was my sunshine and support; I think I should have
      followed Apple Cheek had it not been for Blossom, and Anne's gentle
      courage to hold me up. For all that, my home was a home of clouds and
      gloom; waking or sleeping, sorrow pressed upon me like a great stone. I
      took no joy, growing grim and silent, and far older than my years.
    </p>
    <p>
      One evening when Big Kennedy and I were closeted over some enterprise of
      politics, that memorable exquisite, young Morton, was announced. He
      greeted us with his old-time vacuity of lisp and glance, and after
      mounting that double eyeglass, so potent with the herd, he said:
      &ldquo;Gentlemen, I've come to make some money.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XIV&mdash;THE MULBERRY FRANCHISE
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>HAT'S my purpose
      in a nutshell,&rdquo; lisped young Morton; &ldquo;I've decided to make some money; and
      I've come for millions.&rdquo; Here he waved a delicate hand, and bestowed upon
      Big Kennedy and myself his look of amiable inanity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Millions, eh?&rdquo; returned Big Kennedy, with his metallic grin. &ldquo;I've seen
      whole fam'lies taken the same way. However, I'm glad you're no piker.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If by 'piker,'&rdquo; drawled young Morton, &ldquo;you mean one of those cheap
      persons who play for minimum stakes, I assure you that I should scorn to
      be so described; I should, really! No, indeed; it requires no more of
      thought or effort to play for millions than for ten-dollar bills.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An' dead right you are!&rdquo; observed Big Kennedy with hearty emphasis. &ldquo;A
      sport can buck faro bank for a million as easily as for a white chip. That
      is, if he can find a game that'll turn for such a bundle, an' has th'
      money to back his nerve. What's true of faro is true of business. So
      you're out for millions! I thought your old gent, who's into fifty
      enterprises an' has been for as many years, had long ago shaken down
      mankind for a whole mountain of dough. The papers call him a
      multimillionaire.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Young Morton, still with the empty smile, brought forth a cigarette case.
      The case, gold, was adorned with a ruby whereon to press when one would
      open it, and wore besides the owner's monogram in diamonds. Having lighted
      a cigarette, he polished his eyeglass with a filmy handkerchief.
      Re-establishing the eyeglass on his high patrician nose, he again shone
      vacuously upon Big Kennedy.
    </p>
    <p>
      That personage had watched these manifestations of fastidious culture in a
      spirit of high delight. Big Kennedy liked young Morton; he had long ago
      made out how those dandyisms were no more than a cover for what fund of
      force and cunning dwelt beneath. In truth, Big Kennedy regarded young
      Morton's imbecilities as a most fortunate disguise. His remark would show
      as much. As young Morton&mdash;cigarette just clinging between his lips,
      eye of shallow good humor&mdash;bent towards him, he said, addressing me:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Say! get onto that front! That look of not knowin' nothin' ought by
      itself to cash in for half a million! Did you ever see such a throw-off?&rdquo;
       and here Big Kennedy quite lost himself in a maze of admiration.
      Recovering, however, and again facing our caller, he repeated: &ldquo;Yes, I
      thought your old gent had millions.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Both he and the press,&rdquo; responded young Morton, &ldquo;concede that he has;
      they do, really! Moreover, he possesses, I think, the evidence of it in a
      cord or two of bonds and stocks, don't y' know! But in what fashion, pray,
      does that bear upon my present intentions as I've briefly laid them bare?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No fashion,&rdquo; said Big Kennedy, &ldquo;only I'd naturally s'ppose that when you
      went shy on th' long green, you'd touch th' old gentleman.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Undoubtedly,&rdquo; returned young Morton, &ldquo;I could approach my father with a
      request for money&mdash;that is if my proposal were framed in a spirit of
      moderation, don't y' know!&mdash;say one hundred thousand dollars. But
      such a sum, in my present temper, would be but the shadow of a trifle. I
      owe five times the amount; I do, really! I've no doubt I'm on Tiffany's
      books for more than one hundred thousand, while my bill at the florist's
      should be at least ten thousand dollars, if the pen of that brigand of
      nosegays has kept half pace with his rapacity. However,&rdquo; concluded young
      Morton, breaking into a soft, engaging laugh, &ldquo;since I intend, with your
      aid, to become the master of millions, such bagatelles are unimportant,
      don't y' know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly!&rdquo; observed Big Kennedy in a consolatory tone; &ldquo;they don't
      amount to a deuce in a bum deck. Still, I must say you went in up to your
      neck on sparks an' voylets. I never saw such a plunger on gewgaws an'
      garlands since a yard of cloth made a coat for me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Those bills arose through my efforts to make grand opera beautiful. I set
      the prima donna ablaze with gems; and as for the stage, why, it was like
      singing in a conservatory; it was really!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, let that go!&rdquo; said Big Kennedy, after a pause. &ldquo;I shall be glad if
      through my help you make them millions. If you do, d'ye see, I'll make an
      armful just as big; it's ag'inst my religion to let anybody grab off a
      bigger piece of pie than I do when him an' me is pals. It would lower my
      opinion of myself. However, layin' guff aside, s'ppose you butt in now an'
      open up your little scheme. Let's see what button you think you're goin'
      to push.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is my thought,&rdquo; responded young Morton, and as he spoke the eyeglass
      dropped from its aquiline perch, and under the heat of a real animation
      those mists of affectation were dissipated; &ldquo;this is my thought: I want a
      street railway franchise along Mulberry Avenue, the length of the Island.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go on,&rdquo; said Big Kennedy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's my plan to form a corporation&mdash;-Mulberry Traction. There'll be
      eight millions of preferred stock at eight per cent. I can build and equip
      the road with that. In addition, there'll be ten millions of common
      stock.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you th' people ready to take th' preferred?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ready and waiting. If I had the franchise, I could float those eight
      millions within ten days.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you figger would be th' road's profits?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It would carry four hundred thousand passengers a day, and take in twenty
      thousand dollars. The operating expenses would not exceed an annual four
      millions and a half. That, after the eight per cent, on the preferred were
      paid, would leave over two millions a year on the common&mdash;a dividend
      of twenty per cent., or five per cent, every quarter. You can see where
      such returns would put the stock. You, for your ride, would go into the
      common on the ground floor.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We'll get to how I go in, in a minute,&rdquo; responded Big Kennedy dryly. He
      was impressed by young Morton's proposal, and was threshing it out in his
      mind as they talked. &ldquo;Now, see here,&rdquo; he went on, lowering his brows and
      fixing his keen gray glance on young Morton, &ldquo;you mustn't get restless if
      I ask you questions. I like to tap every wheel an' try every rivet on a
      scheme or a man before I hook up with either.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ask what you please,&rdquo; said young Morton, as brisk as a terrier.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll say this,&rdquo; observed Big Kennedy. &ldquo;That traction notion shows that
      you're a hogshead of horse sense. But of course you understand that you're
      going to need money, an' plenty of it, before you get th' franchise. I can
      take care of th' Tammany push, perhaps; but there's highbinders up to your
      end of th' alley who'll want to be greased.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How much do you argue that I'll require as a preliminary to the grant of
      the franchise?&rdquo; asked young Morton, interrupting Big Kennedy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Every splinter of four hundred thousand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That was my estimate,&rdquo; said young Morton; &ldquo;but I've arranged for twice
      that sum.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who is th' Rothschild you will get it from?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My father,&rdquo; replied young Morton, and now he lapsed anew into his manner
      of vapidity. &ldquo;Really, he takes an eighth of the preferred at par&mdash;one
      million! I've got the money in the bank, don't y' know!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good!&rdquo; ejaculated Big Kennedy, with the gleam which never failed to
      sparkle in his eye at the mention of rotund riches.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My father doesn't know my plans,&rdquo; continued young Morton, his indolence
      and his eyeglass both restored. &ldquo;No; he wouldn't let me tell him; he
      wouldn't, really! I approached him in this wise:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Father,' said I, 'you are aware of the New York alternative?'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'What is it?' he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Get money or get out.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Well!' said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Father, I've decided not to move. Yes, father; after a full
      consideration of the situation, I've resolved to make, say twenty or
      thirty millions for myself; I have, really! It's quite necessary, don't y'
      know; I am absolutely bankrupt. And I don't like it; there's nothing
      comfortable in being bankrupt, it so deucedly restricts a man. Besides,
      it's not good form. I've evolved an idea, however; there's a business I
      can go into.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Store?' he inquired.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'No, no, father,' I replied, for the odious supposition quite upset me;
      'it's nothing so horribly vulgar as trade; it's a speculation, don't y'
      know. There'll be eight millions of preferred stock; you are to take a
      million. Also, you are to give me the million at once.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'What is this speculation?' he asked. 'If I'm to go in for a million, I
      take it you can entrust me with the outlines.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Really, it was on my mind to do so,' I replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'My scheme is this: I shall make an alliance with Mr. Kennedy.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Stop, stop!' cried my father hastily. 'On the whole, I don't care to
      hear your scheme. You shall have the money; but I've decided that it will
      reflect more glory upon you should you bring things to an issue without
      advice from me. Therefore, you need tell me no more; positively, I will
      not hear you.'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was my name made him leary,&rdquo; observed Big Kennedy, with the gratified
      face of one who has been paid a compliment. &ldquo;When you said 'Kennedy,' he
      just about figgered we were out to get a kit of tools an' pry a shutter
      off th' First National. It's th' mugwump notion of Tammany, d'ye see! You
      put him onto it some time, that now I'm Chief I've got center-bits an'
      jimmies skinned to death when it comes to makin' money.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't think it was your name,&rdquo; observed young Morton. &ldquo;He's beginning
      to learn, however, about my voting those three hundred wenches in overalls
      and jumpers, don't y' know, and it has taught him to distrust my methods
      as lacking that element of conservatism which he values so much. It was
      that which came uppermost in his memory, and it occurred to him that
      perhaps the less he knew about my enterprises the sounder he would sleep.
      Is it not remarkable, how fondly even an advanced man like my father will
      cling to the moss-grown and the obsolete?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's no dream neither!&rdquo; exclaimed Big Kennedy, in earnest coincidence
      with young Morton. &ldquo;It's this old fogy business on th' parts of people who
      ought to be leadin' up th' dance for progress, that sends me to bed tired
      in th' middle of th' day!&rdquo; And here Big Kennedy shook his head
      reproachfully at gray ones whose sluggishness had wounded him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My father drew his check,&rdquo; continued young Morton. &ldquo;He couldn't let it
      come to me, however, without a chiding. Wonderful, how the aged like to
      lord it over younger folk with rebukes for following in their footsteps&mdash;really!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'You speak of bankruptcy,' said my father, sucking in his cheeks. 'Would
      it violate confidence should you tell me how you come to be in such a
      disgraceful predicament?' This last was asked in a spirit of sarcasm,
      don't y' know.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'It was by following your advice, sir,' said I.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Following my advice!' exclaimed my father. 'What do you mean, sir? Or
      are you mad?'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Not at all,' I returned. 'Don't you recall how, when I came from
      college, you gave me a world of advice, and laid particular stress on my
      establishing a perfect credit? &ldquo;Nothing is done without credit,&rdquo; you said
      on that occasion; &ldquo;and it should be the care of a young man, as he enters
      upon life, to see to it that his credit is perfect in every quarter of
      trade. He should extend his credit with every opportunity.&rdquo; This counsel
      made a deep impression upon me, it did, really! and so I've extended my
      credit wherever I saw a chance until I owe a half-million. I must say,
      father, that I think it would have saved me money, don't y' know, had you
      told me to destroy my credit as hard as I could. In fostering my credit, I
      but warmed a viper.'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Young Morton paused to fire another cigarette, while the pucker about the
      corner of his eye indicated that he felt as though he had turned the laugh
      upon his father. Following a puff or two, he returned gravely to Mulberry
      Traction.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you approve my proposition?&rdquo; he asked of Big Kennedy, &ldquo;and will you
      give me your aid?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The proposition's all hunk,&rdquo; said Big Kennedy. &ldquo;As to my aid: that
      depends on whether we come to terms.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What share would you want?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Forty per cent, of th' common stock,&rdquo; responded Big Kennedy. &ldquo;That's
      always th' Tammany end; forty per cent.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Young Morton drew in his lips. The figure seemed a surprise. &ldquo;Do you mean
      that you receive four millions of the common stock, you paying nothing?&rdquo;
       he asked at last.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't pony for a sou markee. An' I get th' four millions, d'ye see! Who
      ever heard of Tammany payin' for anything!&rdquo; and Big Kennedy glared about
      the room, and sniffed through his nose, as though in the presence of all
      that might be called preposterous.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But if you put in no money,&rdquo; remonstrated young Morton, &ldquo;why should you
      have the stock? I admit that you ought to be let in on lowest terms; but,
      after all, you should put in something.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I put in my pull,&rdquo; retorted Big Kennedy grimly. &ldquo;You get your franchise
      from me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;From the City,&rdquo; corrected young Morton.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm the City,&rdquo; replied Big Kennedy; &ldquo;an' will be while I'm on top of
      Tammany, an' Tammany's on top of th' town.&rdquo; Then, with a friendliness of
      humor: &ldquo;Here, I like you, an' I'll go out o' my way to educate you on this
      point. You're fly to some things, an' a farmer on others. Now understand:
      The City's a come-on&mdash;a sucker&mdash;an' it belongs to whoever picks
      it up. That's me this trip, d'ye see! Now notice: I've got no office; I'm
      a private citizen same as you, an' I don't owe no duty to th' public.
      Every man has his pull&mdash;his influence. You've got your pull; I've got
      mine. When a man wants anything from th' town, he gets his pull to work.
      In this case, my pull is bigger than all th' other pulls clubbed together.
      You get that franchise or you don't get it, just as I say. In short, you
      get it from me&mdash;get it by my pull, d'ye see! Now why shouldn't I
      charge for th' use of my pull, just as a lawyer asks his fee, or a bank
      demands interest when it lends? My pull's my pull; it's my property as
      much as a bank's money is th' bank's, or a lawyer's brains is the
      lawyer's. I worked hard to get it, an' there's hundreds who'd take it from
      me if they could. There's my doctrine: I'm a private citizen; my pull is
      my capital, an' I'm as much entitled to get action on it in favor of
      myself as a bank has to shave a note. That's why I take forty per cent.
      It's little enough: The franchise will be four-fifths of th' whole value
      of th' road; an' all I have for it is two-fifths of five-ninths, for
      you've got to take into account them eight millions of preferred.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Young Morton was either convinced of the propriety of what Big Kennedy
      urged, or saw&mdash;the latter is the more likely surmise&mdash;that he
      must agree if he would attain success for his enterprise. He made no more
      objection, and those forty per cent, in favor of Big Kennedy were looked
      upon as the thing adjusted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You spoke of four hundred thousand dollars as precedent to the
      franchise,&rdquo; said young Morton. &ldquo;Where will that go?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There's as many as thirty hungry ones who, here an' there an' each in our
      way, must be met an' squared.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How much will go to your fellows?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Most of th' Tammany crowd I can beat into line. But there's twelve who
      won't take orders. They were elected as 'Fusion' candidates, an' they
      think that entitles 'em to play a lone hand. Whenever Tammany gets th'
      town to itself, you can gamble! I'll knock their blocks off quick. You ask
      what it'll take to hold down th' Tammany people? I should say two hundred
      thousand dollars. We'll make it this way: I'll take thirty per cent,
      instead of forty of th' common, an' two hundred thousand in coin. That'll
      be enough to give us th' Tammany bunch as solid as a brick switch shanty.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That should do,&rdquo; observed young Morton thoughtfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      When young Morton was about to go, Big Kennedy detained him with a final
      query.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This aint meant to stick pins into you,&rdquo; said Big Kennedy, &ldquo;but, on th'
      dead! I'd like to learn how you moral an' social high-rollers reconcile
      yourselves to things. How do you agree with yourself to buy them votes
      needed to get th' franchise? Not th' ones I'll bring in, an' which you can
      pretend you don't know about; but them you'll have to deal with
      personally, d'ye see!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There'll be none I'll deal with personally, don't y' know,&rdquo; returned
      young Morton, getting behind his lisp and eyeglass, finding them a refuge
      in what was plainly an embarrassed moment, &ldquo;no; I wouldn't do anything
      with the vulgar creatures in person. They talk such awful English, it gets
      upon my nerves&mdash;really! But I've retained Caucus &amp; Club; they're
      lawyers, only they don't practice law, they practice politics. They'll
      attend to those low details of which you speak. For me to do so wouldn't
      be good form. It would shock my set to death, don't y' know!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's a crawl-out,&rdquo; observed Big Kennedy reproachfully, &ldquo;an' it aint
      worthy of you. Why don't you come to th' center? You're goin' to give up
      four hundred thousand dollars to get this franchise. You don't think it's
      funny&mdash;you don't do it because you like it, an' are swept down in a
      gust of generosity. An' you do think it's wrong.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Really, now you're in error,&rdquo; replied young Morton earnestly, but still
      clinging to his lisp and his languors. &ldquo;As you urge, one has scant
      pleasure in paying this money. On the contrary, I shall find it extremely
      dull, don't y' know! But I don't call it wrong. I'm entitled, under the
      law, and the town's practice&mdash;a highly idiotic one, this latter, I
      concede!&mdash;of giving these franchises away, to come forward with my
      proposition. Since I offer to build a perfect road, and to run it in a
      perfect manner, I ought, as a matter of right&mdash;always bearing in mind
      the town's witless practice aforesaid&mdash;to be granted this franchise.
      But those officers of the city who, acting for the city, should make the
      grant, refuse to do their duty by either the city or myself, unless I pay
      to each of them, say ten thousand dollars; they do, really! What am I to
      do? I didn't select those officers; the public picked them out. Must I
      suffer loss, and go defeated of my rights, because the public was so
      careless or so ignorant as to pitch upon those improper, or, if you will,
      dishonest officials? I say, No. The fault is not mine; surely the loss
      should not be mine. I come off badly enough when I submit to the
      extortion. No, it is no more bribery, so far as I am involved, than it is
      bribery when I surrender my watch to that footpad who has a pistol at my
      ear. In each instance, the public should have saved me and has failed,
      don't y' know. The public, thus derelict, must not denounce me when, under
      conditions which its own neglect has created, I take the one path left
      open to insure myself; it mustn't, really!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Young Morton wiped the drops from his brow, and I could tell how he was
      deeply in earnest in what he thus put forward. Big Kennedy clapped him
      lustily on the back.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Put it there!&rdquo; he cried, extending his hand. &ldquo;I couldn't have said it
      better myself, an' I aint been doin' nothin' but buy aldermen since I cut
      my wisdom teeth. There's one last suggestion, however: I take it, you're
      onto the' fact that Blackberry Traction will lock horns with us over this
      franchise. We parallel their road, d'ye see, an' they'll try to do us up.&rdquo;
       Then to me: &ldquo;Who are th' Blackberry's pets in th' Board?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;McGinty and Doloran,&rdquo; I replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Keep your peepers on them babies. You can tell by th' way they go to bat,
      whether th' Blackberry has signed up to them to kill our franchise.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can tell on the instant,&rdquo; I said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That has all been anticipated,&rdquo; observed young Morton. &ldquo;The president of
      Blackberry Traction is a member of my club; we belong in the same social
      set. I foresaw his opposition, and I've provided for it; I have, really!
      McGinty and Doloran, you say? The names sound like the enemy. Please post
      me if those interesting individuals move for our disfavor.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And now we went to work. Whatever was demanded of the situation as it
      unfolded found prompt reply, and in the course of time Mulberry Traction
      was given its franchise. The Blackberry at one crisis came forward to work
      an interruption; the sudden hot enmity of McGinty and Doloran was
      displayed. I gave notice of it to young Morton.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll arrange the matter,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;At the next meeting of the Board I
      think they will be with us, don't y' know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was even so; and since Big Kennedy, with my aid, discharged every
      responsibility that was his, the ordinance granting the franchise went
      through, McGinty and Doloran voting loudly with the affirmative. They were
      stubborn caitiffs, capable of much destructive effort, and their final
      tameness won upon my surprise. I put the question of it to young Morton.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is the secret of that miracle,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;The president of
      Blackberry has been a Wall Street loser, don't y' know, for more than a
      year&mdash;has lost more than he could honestly pay. And yet he paid!
      Where did he get the money? At first I asked myself the question in a
      feeling of lazy curiosity. When I decided to organize our Mulberry
      Traction, I asked it in earnest; I did, really! I foresaw my friend's
      opposition, and was seeking a weapon against him. Wherefore I looked him
      over with care, trying to determine where he got his loans. Now, he was
      the president, and incidentally a director, of the Confidence Trust
      Company. I bought stock in the Confidence. Then I drew into my interest
      that employee who had charge of the company's loans. I discovered that our
      Blackberry president had borrowed seven millions from the Trust Company,
      giving as security a collection of dogs and cats and chips and whetstones,
      don't y' know! That was wrong; considering his position as an officer of
      the company, it was criminal. I made myself master of every proof required
      to establish his guilt in court. Then I waited. When you told me of those
      evil symptoms manifested by McGinty and Doloran, I took our president into
      the Fifth Avenue window of the club and showed him those evidences of his
      sins. He looked them over, lighted a cigar, and after musing for a moment,
      asked if the help of McGinty and Doloran for our franchise would make
      towards my gratification. I told him I would be charmed&mdash;really! You
      know the rest. Oh, no; I did not do so rude a thing as threaten an arrest.
      It wasn't required. Our president is a highly intellectual man. Besides,
      it wouldn't have been clubby; and it would have been bad form. And,&rdquo;
       concluded young Morton, twirling his little cane, and putting on that look
      of radiant idiocy, &ldquo;I've an absolute mania for everything that's form,
      don't y' know.&rdquo;

      CHAPTER XV&mdash;THAT GAS COMPANY INJUNCTION
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">Y</span>OUNG MORTON was
      president of Mulberry Traction. When the franchise came sound and safe
      into the hands of Mulberry, young Morton evolved a construction company
      and caused himself to be made president and manager thereof. These affairs
      cleared up, he went upon the building of his road with all imaginable
      spirit. He was still that kid-gloved, eve-glassed exquisite of other
      hours, but those who dealt with him in his road-building knew in him a
      hawk to see and a lion to act in what he went about. Big Kennedy was never
      weary of his name, and glowed at its merest mention.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He's no show-case proposition!&rdquo; cried Big Kennedy exultantly. &ldquo;To look at
      him, folks might take him for a fool. They'd bring him back, you bet! if
      they did. You've got to see a party in action before you can tell about
      him. A mudscow will drift as fast as an eight-oared shell; it's only when
      you set 'em to goin' endwise, an' give 'em a motive, you begin to get onto
      th' difference.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      One day young Morton told me how the Gas Company had lodged suit against
      Mulberry.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They've gotten a beastly injunction, they have, really!&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;They
      say we're digging, don't y' know, among their pipes and mains. The hearing
      is put down for one week from to-day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Gas Company goes vastly out of its way in this!&rdquo; observed the
      reputable old gentleman indignantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had arrived in company with young Morton. When now the franchise was
      obtained, and those more devious steps for Mulberry advancement had been
      taken, the reputable old gentleman began to feel a vigorous interest in
      his son's enterprise. The reputable old gentleman had grown proud of his
      son, and it should be conceded that young Morton justified the paternal
      admiration.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let us go over to Tammany Hall,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;and talk with Big Kennedy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      We found Big Kennedy in cheerful converse with the Reverend Bronson, over
      the latter's Five Points Mission. He and the dominie were near Big
      Kennedy's desk; in a far corner lolled a drunken creature, tattered,
      unshorn, disreputable, asleep and snoring in his chair. As I entered the
      room, accompanied by the reputable old gentleman and young Morton, Big
      Kennedy was giving the Reverend Bronson certain hearty assurances of his
      good will.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll see to it to-day,&rdquo; Big Kennedy was saying. &ldquo;You go back an' deal
      your game. I'll have two cops detailed to every meetin', d'ye see, an'
      their orders will be to break their night-sticks over th' head of th'
      first duck that laughs or makes a row. You always come to me for what you
      want; you can hock your socks I'll back you up. What this town needs is
      religious teachin' of an elevated kind, an' no bunch of Bowery bums is
      goin' to give them exercises th' smother. An' that goes!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm sure I'm much obliged,&rdquo; murmured the Reverend Bronson, preparing to
      take himself away. Then, turning curious: &ldquo;May I ask who that lost and
      abandoned man is?&rdquo; and he indicated the drunkard, snoring in his chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don't know him,&rdquo; returned Big Kennedy, in a tone of confident,
      friendly patronage. &ldquo;Just now he's steeped in bug juice to th' eyes, an'
      has been for a week. But I'm goin' to need him; so I had him brought in.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of what earthly use can one who has fallen so low be put to?&rdquo; asked the
      Reverend Bronson. Then, with a shudder: &ldquo;Look at him!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An' that's where you go wrong!&rdquo; replied Big Kennedy, who was in one of
      his philosophical humors. &ldquo;Now if it was about morals, or virtue, or th'
      hereafter, I wouldn't hand you out a word. That's your game, d'ye see, an'
      when it's a question of heaven, you've got me beat. But there's other
      games, like Tammany Hall for instance, where I could give you cards an'
      spades. Now take that sot there: I know what he can do, an' what I want
      him for, an' inside of a week I'll be makin' him as useful as a corkscrew
      in Kentucky.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He seems a most unpromising foundation upon which to build one's hope,&rdquo;
       said the Reverend Bronson dubiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He aint much to look at, for fair!&rdquo; responded Big Kennedy, in his large
      tolerant way. &ldquo;But you mustn't bet your big stack on a party's looks. You
      can't tell about a steamboat by th' coat of paint on her sides; you must
      go aboard. Now that fellow&rdquo;&mdash;here he pointed to the sleeping drunkard&mdash;&ldquo;once
      you get th' booze out of him, has a brain like a buzzsaw. An' you should
      hear him talk! He's got a tongue so acid it would eat through iron. The
      fact is, th' difference between that soak an' th' best lawyer at the New
      York bar is less'n one hundred dollars. I'll have him packed off to a
      Turkish bath, sweat th' whisky out of him, have him shaved an' his hair
      cut, an' get him a new suit of clothes. When I'm through, you won't know
      him. He'll run sober for a month, which is as long as I'll need him this
      trip.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And will he then return to his drunkenness?&rdquo; asked the Reverend Bronson.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sure as you're alive!&rdquo; said Big Kennedy. &ldquo;The moment I take my hooks off
      him, down he goes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What you say interests me! Why not send him to my mission, and let me
      compass his reform.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You might as well go down to th' morgue an' try an' revive th' dead. No,
      no, Doctor; that duck is out of humanity's reach. If you took him in hand
      at your mission, he'd show up loaded some night an' tip over your works.
      Better pass him up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If his case is so hopeless, I marvel that you tolerate him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Reverend Bronson was a trifle piqued at Big Kennedy for thinking his
      influence would fall short of the drunkard's reform.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You aint onto this business of bein' Chief of Tammany,&rdquo; responded Big
      Kennedy, with his customary grin. &ldquo;I always like to do my work through
      these incurables. It's better to have men about you who are handicapped by
      some big weakness, d'ye see! They're strong on th' day you need 'em, an'
      weak when you lay 'em down. Which makes it all the better. If these people
      were strong all th' year 'round, one of 'em, before we got through, would
      want my job, an' begin to lay pipes to get it. Some time, when I wasn't
      watchin', he might land th' trick at that. No, as hands to do my work,
      give me fellows who've got a loose screw in their machinery. They're less
      chesty; an' then they work better, an' they're safer. I've only one man
      near me who don't show a blemish. That's him,&rdquo; and he pointed to where I
      sat waiting with young Morton and the reputable old gentleman. &ldquo;I'll trust
      him; because I'm goin' to make him Boss when I get through; an' he knows
      it. That leaves him without any reason for doin' me up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Big Kennedy called one of his underlings, and gave him directions to have
      the sleeping drunkard conveyed instantly to a bath-house.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Get th' kinks out of him,&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;an' bring him back to me in four
      days. I want to see him as straight as a string, an' dressed as though for
      a weddin'. I'm goin' to need him to make a speech, d'ye see! at that
      mugwump ratification meetin' in Cooper Union.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When the Reverend Bronson, and the drunken Cicero, in care of his keeper,
      had gone their several ways, Big Kennedy wheeled upon us. He was briefly
      informed of the troubles of Mulberry Traction.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If them gas crooks don't hold hard,&rdquo; said he, when young Morton had
      finished, &ldquo;we'll have an amendment to th' city charter passed at Albany,
      puttin' their meters under th' thumb an' th' eye of th' Board of Lightin'
      an' Supplies. I wonder how they'd like that! It would cut sixty per cent,
      off their gas bills. However, mebby th' Gas Company's buttin' into this
      thing in th' dark. What judge does the injunction come up before?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Judge Mole,&rdquo; said young Morton.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mole, eh?&rdquo; returned Big Kennedy thoughtfully. &ldquo;We'll shift th' case to
      some other judge. Mole won't do; he's th' Gas Company's judge, d'ye see.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Gas Company's judge!&rdquo; exclaimed the reputable old gentleman, in
      horrified amazement.
    </p>
    <p>
      Big Kennedy, at this, shone down upon the reputable old gentleman like a
      benignant sun.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Slowly but surely,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;you begin to tumble to th' day an' th' town
      you're livin' in. Don't you know that every one of our giant companies has
      its own judge? Why! one of them Captains of Industry, as th' papers call
      'em, would no more be without his judge than without his stenographer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In what manner,&rdquo; snorted the reputable old gentleman, &ldquo;does one of our
      great corporations become possessed of a judge?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Simple as sloppin' out champagne!&rdquo; returned Big Kennedy. &ldquo;It asks us to
      nominate him. Then it comes up with his assessment, d'ye see!&mdash;an'
      I've known that to run as high as one hundred thousand&mdash;an' then
      every year it contributes to our various campaigns, say fifty thousand
      dollars a whirl. Oh! it comes high to have your own private judge; but if
      you're settin' into a game of commerce where th' limit's higher than a
      cat's back, it's worth a wise guy's while.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, come!&rdquo; interposed young Morton, &ldquo;we've no time for moral and
      political abstractions, don't y' know! Let's get back to Mulberry
      Traction. You say Judge Mole won't do. Can you have the case set down
      before another judge?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Easy money!&rdquo; said Big Kennedy. &ldquo;I'll have Mole send it over to Judge
      Flyinfox. He'll knock it on th' head, when it comes up, an' that's th'
      last we'll ever hear of that injunction.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You speak of Judge Flyinfox with confidence,&rdquo; observed the reputable old
      gentleman, breaking in. &ldquo;Why are you so certain he will dismiss the
      application for an injunction?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because,&rdquo; retorted Big Kennedy, in his hardy way, &ldquo;he comes up for
      renomination within two months. He'd look well throwin' the harpoon into
      me right now, wouldn't he?&rdquo; Then, as the double emotions of wrath and
      wonder began to make purple the visage of the reputable old gentleman:
      &ldquo;Look here: you're more'n seven years old. Why should you think a judge
      was different from other men? Haven't you seen men crawl in th' sewer of
      politics on their hands an' knees, an' care for nothin' only so they
      crawled finally into th' Capitol at Albany? Is a judge any better than a
      governor? Or is either of 'em any better than other people? While Tammany
      makes th' judges, do you s'ppose they'll be too good for th' organization?
      That last would be a cunnin' play to make!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But these judges,&rdquo; said the reputable old gentleman. &ldquo;Their terms are so
      long and their salaries so large, I should think they would defy you and
      your humiliating orders.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Exactly,&rdquo; returned Big Kennedy, with the pleasant air of one aware of
      himself, &ldquo;an' that long term an' big salary works square th' other way.
      There's so many of them judges that there's one or two to be re-elected
      each year. So we've always got a judge whose term is on th' blink, d'ye
      see! An' he's got to come to us&mdash;to me, if you want it plain&mdash;to
      get back. You spoke of th' big salary an' th' long term. Don't you see
      that you've only given them guys more to lose? Now th' more a party has to
      lose, th' more he'll bow and scrape to save himself. Between us, a judge
      within a year or so of renomination is th' softest mark on th' list.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The reputable old gentleman expressed unbounded indignation, while Big
      Kennedy laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What're you kickin' about?&rdquo; asked Big Kennedy, when he had somewhat
      recovered. &ldquo;That's the 'Boss System.' Just now, d'ye see! it's water on
      your wheel, so you oughtn't to raise th' yell. But to come back to
      Mulberry Traction: We'll have Mole send th' case to Flyinfox; an' Flyinfox
      will put th' kybosh on it, if it comes up. But I'll let you into a secret.
      Th' case'll never come up; th' Gas Company will go back to its corner.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Explain,&rdquo; said young Morton eagerly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because I'll tell 'em to.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you mean that you'll go to the Gas Company,&rdquo; sneered the reputable old
      gentleman, &ldquo;and give its officers orders the same as you say you give them
      to the State's and the City's officers?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Th' Gas Company'll come to me, an' ask for orders.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The reputable old gentleman drew a long breath, while his brows worked up
      and down.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And dare you tell me,&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;that men of millions&mdash;our leading
      men of business, will come to you and ask your commands?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My friend,&rdquo; replied Big Kennedy gravely, &ldquo;no matter how puffed up an' big
      these leadin' men of business get to be, th' Chief of Tammany is a bigger
      toad than any. Listen: th' bigger the target th' easier th' shot. If
      you'll come down here with me for a month, I'll gamble you'll meet an'
      make th' acquaintance of every business king in th' country. An' you'll
      notice, too, that they'll take off their hats, an' listen to what I say;
      an' in th' end, they'll do what I tell 'em to do.&rdquo; Big Kennedy glowered
      impressively upon the reputable old gentleman. &ldquo;That sounds like a song
      that is sung, don't it?&rdquo; Then turning to me: &ldquo;Tell th' Street Department
      not to give th' Gas Company any more permits to open streets until further
      orders. An' now&rdquo;&mdash;coming back to the reputable old gentleman&mdash;&ldquo;can't
      you see what'll come off?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The reputable old gentleman looked mystified. Young Morton, for his part,
      began to smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He sees!&rdquo; exclaimed Big Kennedy, pointing to young Morton. &ldquo;Here's
      what'll happen. Th' Gas Company has to have two hundred permits a day to
      tear open th' streets. After that order reaches the Street Commissioner,
      it won't get any.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Better see the Boss,' the Street Commissioner will whisper, when the Gas
      Company asks what's wrong.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The next day one of th' deck hands will come to see me. I'll turn him
      down; th' Chief of Tammany don't deal with deck hands. The next day th'
      Gas Company will send th' first mate. The mate'll get turned down; th'
      Chief of Tammany deals with nobody less'n a captain, d'ye see! On th'
      third day, or to put it like a prophet, say next Friday&mdash;since this
      is Tuesday&mdash;th' president of th' Gas Company will drive here in his
      brougham. I'll let him wait ten minutes in the outer room to take the
      swell out of his head. Then I'll let him in, an', givin' him th' icy eye,
      I'll ask: 'What's th' row?' Th' Gas Company will have been three days
      without permits to open th' streets;&mdash;its business will be at a
      standstill;&mdash;th' Gas Company'll be sweatin' blood. There'll be th'
      Gas Company's president, an' here'll be Big John Kennedy. I think that
      even you can furnish th' wind-up. As I tell you, now that I've had time to
      think it out, th' case will be withdrawn. Still, to make sure, we'll have
      Mole send th' papers over to Flyinfox, just as though we had nowhere
      except th' courts to look for justice.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      On Monday, the day before the case was to have been called, the Gas
      Company, humbled and made penitent with a stern paucity of &ldquo;permits,&rdquo;
       dismissed its petition for an injunction against Mulberry Traction, and
      young Morton returned to his career, unchecked of a court's decree.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Father,&rdquo; said young Morton, as we came from our interview with Big
      Kennedy, &ldquo;I'm not sure that the so-called Boss System for the Government
      of Cities is wholly without its advantages, don't y' know!&rdquo; And here young
      Morton puffed a complacent, not to say superior, cigarette.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Humph!&rdquo; retorted the reputable old gentleman angrily. &ldquo;Every Esau,
      selling his birthright for a mess of pottage, would speak the same.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Esau with a cigarette&mdash;really!&rdquo; murmured young Morton, giving a
      ruminative puff. &ldquo;But I say, father, it isn't a mess of pottage, don't y'
      know, it's a street railway.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As Mulberry Traction approached completion, the common stock reached
      forty. At that point Big Kennedy closed out his interest. Snapping the
      catchlock behind us, to the end that we be alone, he tossed a dropsical
      gray envelope on the table.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There's two hundred thousand dollars' worth of Uncle Sam's bonds,&rdquo; said
      he. &ldquo;That's your end of Mulberry Traction.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You've sold out?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sold out an' got one million two hundred thousand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The stock would have gone higher,&rdquo; said I. &ldquo;You would have gotten more if
      you'd held on.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wall Street,&rdquo; returned Big Kennedy, with a cautious shake of the head,
      &ldquo;is off my beat. I'm afraid of them stock sharps; I feel like a come-on
      th' minute I begin to talk with one, an' I wouldn't trust 'em as far as I
      could throw a dog by th' tail. I break away as fast as ever I can, an'
      chase back to Fourteenth Street, where I'm wise to th' game. I've seen
      suckers like me who took a million dollars into Wall Street, an' came out
      in a week with nothin' but a pocket full of canceled postage stamps.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I've been told,&rdquo; said I with a laugh, and going with Big Kennedy's humor,
      &ldquo;that two hundred years ago, Captain Kidd, the pirate, had his home on the
      site of the present Stock Exchange.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did he?&rdquo; said Big Kennedy. &ldquo;Well, I figger that his crew must have lived
      up an' down both sides of the street from him, an' their descendants are
      still holdin' down th' property. An' to think,&rdquo; mused Big Kennedy, &ldquo;that
      Trinity Church stares down th' length of Wall Street, with th' graves in
      th' Trinity churchyard to remind them stock wolves of th' finish! I'm a
      hard man, an' I play a hard game, but on th' level! if I was as big a
      robber as them Wall Street sharps, I couldn't look Trinity Church in th'
      face!&rdquo; Then, coming back to Mulberry Traction and to me: &ldquo;I've put it in
      bonds, d'ye see! Now if I was you, I'd stand pat on 'em just as they are.
      Lay 'em away, an' think to yourself they're for that little Blossom of
      yours.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At the name of Blossom, Big Kennedy laid his heavy hand on mine as might
      one who asked a favor. It was the thing unusual. Big Kennedy's rough husk
      gave scanty promise of any softness of sentiment to lie beneath. Somehow,
      the word and the hand brought the water to my eyes.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is precisely what I mean to do,&rdquo; said I. &ldquo;Blossom is to have it, an'
      have it as it is&mdash;two hundred thousand dollars in bonds.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Big Kennedy, with that, gave my hand a Titan's grip in indorsement of my
      resolve.
    </p>
    <p>
      Blossom was growing up a frail, slender child, and still with her
      frightened eyes. Anne watched over her; and since Blossom lacked in
      sturdiness of health, she did not go to a school, but was taught by Anne
      at home. Blossom's love was for me; she clung to me when I left the house,
      and was in my arms the moment the door opened upon my return. She was the
      picture of my lost Apple Cheek, wanting her roundness, and my eyes went
      wet and weary with much looking upon her.
    </p>
    <p>
      My home was quiet and, for me, gloomy. Anne, I think, was happy in a
      manner pensive and undemonstrative. As for Blossom, that terror she drew
      in from her mother when the latter was struck by the blow of my arrest for
      the death of Jimmy the Blacksmith, still held its black dominion over her
      fancy; and while with time she grew away from those agitations and
      hysterias which enthralled her babyhood, she lived ever in a twilight of
      melancholy that nothing could light up, and from which her spirit never
      emerged. In all her life I never heard her laugh, and her smile, when she
      did smile, was as the soul of a sigh. And so my house was a house of
      whispers and shadows and silences as sad as death&mdash;a house of sorrow
      for my lost Apple Cheek, and fear for Blossom whose life was stained with
      nameless mourning before ever she began to live at all.
    </p>
    <p>
      Next door to me I had brought my father and mother to dwell. Anne, who
      abode with me, could oversee both houses. The attitude of Big Kennedy
      towards Old Mike had not been wanting in effect upon me. The moment my
      money was enough, I took my father from his forge, and set both him and my
      mother to a life of workless ease. I have feared more than once that this
      move was one not altogether wise. My people had been used to labor, and
      when it was taken out of their hands they knew not where to turn with
      their time. They were much looked up to by neighbors for the power and
      position I held in the town's affairs; and each Sunday they could give the
      church a gold piece, and that proved a mighty boon to their pride. But, on
      the whole, the leisure of their lives, and they unable to employ it,
      carked and corroded them, and it had not a little to do in breaking down
      their health. They were in no sense fallen into the vale of years, when
      one day they were seized by a pneumonia and&mdash;my mother first, with
      her patient peasant face! and my father within the week that followed&mdash;passed
      both to the other life.
    </p>
    <p>
      And now when I was left with only Blossom and Anne to love, and to be dear
      and near to me, I went the more among men, and filled still more my head
      and hands and heart with politics. I must have action, motion. Grief
      walked behind me; and, let me but halt, it was never long in coming up.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sundry years slipped by, and the common routine work of the organization
      engaged utterly both Big Kennedy and myself. We struggled heartily, and
      had our ups and our downs, our years of black and our years of white. The
      storm that wrecked Big Kennedy's predecessor had left Tammany in shallow,
      dangerous waters for its sailing. Also Big Kennedy and I were not without
      our personal enemies. We made fair weather of it, however, particularly
      when one considers the broken condition of Tammany, and the days were not
      desolate of their rewards.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now ensues a great heave upward in my destinies.
    </p>
    <p>
      One evening I came upon Big Kennedy, face gray and drawn, sitting as still
      as a church. Something in the look or the attitude went through me like a
      lance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What's wrong?&rdquo; I asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There was a saw-bones here,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;pawin' me over for a
      life-insurance game that I thought I'd buy chips in. He tells me my
      light's goin' to flicker out inside a year. That's a nice number to hand a
      man! Just as a sport finds himself on easy street, along comes a scientist
      an' tells him it's all off an' nothin' for it but the bone-yard! Well,&rdquo;
       concluded Big Kennedy, grimly lighting a cigar, &ldquo;if it's up to me, I
      s'ppose I can hold down a hearse as good as th' next one. If it's th' best
      they can do, why, let her roll!&rdquo;

      CHAPTER XVI&mdash;THE BOSS IS DEAD; LONG LIVE THE BOSS!
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">B</span>IG KENNEDY could
      not live a year; his doom was written. It was the word hard to hear, and
      harder to believe, of one who, broad, burly, ruddy with the full color of
      manhood at its prime, seemed in the very feather of his strength. And for
      all that, his hour was on its way. Death had gained a lodgment in his
      heart, and was only pausing to strengthen its foothold before striking the
      blow. I sought to cheer him with the probability of mistake on the side of
      ones who had given him this dark warning of his case.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's all right,&rdquo; responded Big Kennedy in a tone of dogged dejection;
      &ldquo;I'm up ag'inst it just th' same. It didn't need th' doctor to put me on.
      More'n once I've felt my heart slip a cog. I shall clean up an' quit. They
      say if I pull out an' rest, I may hang on for a year. That's th' tip I've
      got, an' I'm goin' to take it. I'm two millions to th' good, an' when all
      is done, why, that's enough.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Big Kennedy declared for a vacation; the public announcement went for it
      that he would rest. I was to take control as a fashion of Boss by brevet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; said Big Kennedy when we talked privately of the situation,
      &ldquo;you understand. I'm down an' out, done for an' as good as dead right now.
      But it's better to frame th' play as I've proposed. Don't change th' sign
      over th' door for a month or two; it'll give you time to stiffen your
      grip. There's dubs who would like th' job, d'ye see, an' if they found an
      openin' they'd spill you out of th' place like a pup out of a basket. It's
      for you to get your hooks on th' levers, an' be in control of th' machine
      before I die.&rdquo; Then, with a ghastly smile: &ldquo;An' seein' it's you, I'll put
      off croakin! till th' last call of th' board.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Big Kennedy, seeking that quiet which had been the physician's
      prescription, went away. When, later by ten months, he came back, his
      appearance was a shock to me. The great, bluff man was gone, and he who
      feebly took me by the hand seemed no more than a weak shadow of that Big
      John Kennedy whom I had followed. The mere looks of him were like a
      knife-stab. He stayed but a day, and then returned to his retreat in the
      silent hills. Within a month Big Kennedy was dead.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You've got things nailed,&rdquo; said he, on the last evening, &ldquo;an' I'm glad
      it's so. Now let me give you a few points; they may help you to hold down
      your place as Boss. You're too hungry for revenge; there's your weakness.
      The revenge habit is worse than a taste for whisky. Th' best you can say
      for it is it's a waste of time. When you've downed a man, stop. To go on
      beatin' him is like throwin' water on a drowned rat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When it comes to handin' out th' offices an' th' contracts, don't play
      fav'rites. Hand every man what's comin' to him by th' rules of th' game.
      It'll give you more power to have men say you'll do what's square, than
      that you'll stick by your friends. Good men&mdash;dead-game men, don't
      want favors; they want justice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never give a man the wrong office; size every man up, an' measure him for
      his place th' same as a tailor does for a suit of clothes. If you give a
      big man a little office, you make an enemy; if you give a little man a big
      office, you make trouble.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Flatter th' mugwumps. Of course, their belfry is full of bats; but about
      half th' time they have to be your pals, d'ye see, in order to be
      mugwumps. An' you needn't be afraid of havin' 'em around; they'll never
      ketch onto anything. A mugwump, as some wise guy said, is like a man
      ridin' backward in a carriage; he never sees a thing until it's by.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Say 'No' nineteen times before you say 'Yes' once. People respect th' man
      who says 'No,' an' his 'Yes' is worth more where he passes it out. When
      you say 'No,' you play your own game; when you say 'Yes,' you're playin'
      some other duck's game. 'No,' keeps; 'Yes,' gives; an' th' gent who says
      'No' most will always be th' biggest toad in his puddle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't be fooled by a cheer or by a crowd. Cheers are nothin' but a
      breeze; an' as for a crowd, no matter who you are, there would always be a
      bigger turn-out to see you hanged than to shake your mit.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Always go with th' current; that's th' first rule of leadership. It's
      easier; an' there's more water down stream than up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Think first, last, an' all th' time of yourself. You may not be of
      account to others, but you're the whole box of tricks to yourself. Don't
      give a man more than he gives you. Folks who don't stick to that steer
      land either in bankruptcy or Bloomin'dale.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An' remember: while you're Boss, you'll be forced into many things
      ag'inst your judgment. The head of Tammany is like th' head of a snake,
      an' gets shoved forward by the tail. Also, like th' head of a snake, th'
      Boss is th' target for every rock that is thrown.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have as many lieutenants as you can; twenty are safer than two. Two might
      fake up a deal with each other to throw you down; twenty might start, but
      before they got to you they'd fight among themselves.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have people about you who distrust each other an' trust you. Keep th'
      leaders fightin' among themselves. That prevents combinations ag'inst you;
      an' besides they'll do up each other whenever you say the word, where
      every man is hated by the rest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Always pay your political debts; but pay with a jolly as far as it'll go.
      If you find one who won't take a jolly, throw a scare into him and pay him
      with that. If he's a strong, dangerous mug with whom a jolly or a bluff
      won't work, get him next to you as fast as you can. If you strike an
      obstinate party, it's th' old rule for drivin' pigs. If you want 'em to go
      forward, pull 'em back by th' tails. Never trust a man beyond his
      interest; an' never love the man, love what he does.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The whole science of leadership lies in what I've told you, an' if you
      can clinch onto it, you'll stick at th' top till you go away, like I do
      now, to die. An' th' last of it is, don't get sentimental&mdash;don't take
      politics to heart. Politics is only worth while so long as it fills your
      pockets. Don't tie yourself to anything. A political party is like a
      street car; stay with it only while it goes your way. A great partisan can
      never be a great Boss.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When I found myself master of Tammany, my primary thought was to be
      cautious. I must strengthen myself; I must give myself time to take root.
      This was the more necessary, for not only were there a full score of the
      leaders, any one of whom would prefer himself for my place, but the
      political condition was far from reassuring. The workingman&mdash;whom as
      someone said we all respect and avoid&mdash;was through his unions moving
      to the town's conquest. It was as that movement of politics in the land of
      the ancient Nile. Having discovered a Moses, the hand-workers would offer
      him for the mayoralty on the issue of no more bricks without straw.
    </p>
    <p>
      Skilled to the feel of sentiment, I could gauge both the direction and the
      volume of the new movement. Nor was I long in coming to the knowledge that
      behind it marched a majority of the people. Unless checked, or cheated,
      that labor uprising would succeed; Tammany and its old-time enemies would
      alike go down.
    </p>
    <p>
      This news, self-furnished as a grist ground of the mills of my own
      judgment, stimulated me to utmost action. It would serve neither my
      present nor my future should that battle which followed my inauguration be
      given against me. I was on my trial; defeat would be the signal for my
      overthrow. And thus I faced my first campaign as Boss.
    </p>
    <p>
      That rebellion of the working folk stirred to terror the conservatives,
      ever the element of wealth. Each man with a share of stock to shrink in
      value, or with a dollar loaned and therefore with security to shake, or
      with a store through the plate-glass panes of which a mob might hurl a
      stone, was prey to a vast alarm. The smug citizen of money, and of
      ease-softened hands, grew sick as he reflected on the French Revolution;
      and he predicted gutters red with blood as the near or far finale should
      the town's peasantry gain the day. It was then those rich ones, panic-bit,
      began to ask a succor of Tammany Hall. There were other septs, but Tammany
      was the drilled, traditional corps of political janissaries. Wherefore,
      the local nobility, being threatened, fled to it for refuge.
    </p>
    <p>
      These gentry of white faces and frightened pocket-books came to me by ones
      and twos and quartettes; my every day was filled with them; and their one
      prayer was for me to make a line of battle between them and that frowning
      peril of the mob. To our silken worried ones, I replied nothing. I heard;
      but I kept myself as mute for hope or for fear as any marble.
    </p>
    <p>
      And yet it was sure from the beginning that I must make an alliance with
      my folk of purple. The movement they shuddered over was even more of a
      menace to Tammany than it was to them. It might mean dollars to them, but
      for Tammany it promised annihilation, since of every five who went with
      this crusade, four were recruited from the machine.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fifth Avenue, in a fever, did not realize this truth. Nor was I one to
      enlighten my callers. Their terror made for the machine; it could be
      trained to fill the Tammany treasure chest with a fund to match those
      swelling fears, the reason of its contribution. I locked up my tongue; it
      was a best method to augment a mugwump horror which I meant should find my
      resources.
    </p>
    <p>
      Young Morton, still with his lisp, his affectations, his scented gloves,
      and ineffable eyeglass, although now no longer &ldquo;young,&rdquo; but like myself in
      the middle journey of his life, was among my patrician visitors. Like the
      others, he came to urge a peace-treaty between Tammany and the mugwumps,
      and he argued a future stored of fortune for both myself and the machine,
      should the latter turn to be a defense for timid deer from whom he came
      ambassador.
    </p>
    <p>
      To Morton I gave particular ear. I was never to forget that loyalty
      wherewith he stood to me on a day of trial for the death of Jimmy the
      Blacksmith. If any word might move me it would be his. Adhering to a plan,
      however, I had as few answers for his questions as I had for those of his
      mates, and wrapped myself in silence like a mantle.
    </p>
    <p>
      Morton was so much his old practical self that he bade me consider a
      candidate and a programme.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let us nominate my old gentleman for mayor,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;He's very old; but
      he's clean and he's strong, don't y' know. Really he would draw every vote
      to his name that should of right belong to us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That might be,&rdquo; I returned; &ldquo;but I may tell you, and stay within the
      truth, that if your father got no more votes than should of right be his,
      defeat would overtake him to the tune of thousands. Add the machine to the
      mugwumps, and this movement of labor still has us beaten by twenty
      thousand men. That being the case, why should I march Tammany&mdash;and my
      own fortune, too&mdash;into such a trap?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What else can you do?&rdquo; asked Morton.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can tell you what was in my mind,&rdquo; said I. &ldquo;It was to go with this
      labor movement and control it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That labor fellow they've put up would make the worst of mayors. You and
      Tammany would forever be taunted with the errors of his administration.
      Besides, the creature's success would vulgarize the town; it would,
      really!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is an honest man,&rdquo; said I.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Honest, yes; but what of that? Honesty is the commonest trait of
      ignorance. There should be something more than honesty, don't y' know, to
      make a mayor. There be games like draw poker and government where to be
      merely honest is not a complete equipment. Besides, think of the shock of
      such a term of hobnails in the City Hall. If you, with your machine, would
      come in, we could elect my old gentleman over him or any other merely
      honest candidate whom those vulgarians could put up; we could, really!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell me how,&rdquo; said I.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There would be millions of money,&rdquo; lisped Morton, pausing to select a
      cigarette; &ldquo;since Money would be swimming for dear life. All our fellows
      at the club are scared to death&mdash;really! One can do anything with
      money, don't y' know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One can't stop a runaway horse with money,&rdquo; I retorted; &ldquo;and this labor
      movement is a political runaway.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;With money we could build a wall across its course and let those idiots
      of politics run against it. My dear fellow, let us make a calculation.
      Really, how many votes should those labor animals overrun us, on the
      situation's merits?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Say twenty-five thousand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This then should give so experienced a hand as yourself some shade of
      comfort. The Master of the Philadelphia Machine, don't y' know, is one of
      my railway partners. 'Old chap,' said he, when I told him of the doings of
      our New York vandals, 'I'll send over to you ten thousand men, any one of
      whom would loot a convent. These common beggars must be put down! The
      example might spread to Philadelphia.' So you see,&rdquo; concluded Morton, &ldquo;we
      would not be wanting in election material. What should ten thousand men
      mean?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At the least,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;they should count for forty thousand. A man votes
      with a full beard; then he votes with his chin shaved; then he shaves the
      sides of his face and votes with a mustache; lastly he votes with a smooth
      face and retires to re-grow a beard against the next campaign. Ten
      thousand men should tally forty thousand votes. Registration and all,
      however, would run the cost of such an enterprise to full five hundred
      thousand dollars.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Money is no object,&rdquo; returned Morton, covering a yawn delicately with his
      slim hand, &ldquo;to men who feel that their fortunes, don't y' know, and
      perhaps their lives, are on the cast. Bring us Tammany for this one war,
      and I'll guarantee three millions in the till of the machine; I will,
      really! You would have to take those ten thousand recruits from
      Philadelphia into your own hands, however; we Silk Stockings don't own the
      finesse required to handle such a consignment of goods. Besides, if we
      did, think what wretched form it would be.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      To hide what was in my thought, I made a pretense of considering the
      business in every one of its angles. There was a minute during which
      neither of us spoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why should I put the machine,&rdquo; I asked at last, &ldquo;in unnecessary peril of
      the law? This should be a campaign of fire. Every stick of those three
      millions you speak of would go to stoke the furnaces. I will do as well,
      and win more surely, with the labor people.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But do you want to put the mob in possession?&rdquo; demanded Morton, emerging
      a bit from his dandyisms. &ldquo;I'm no purist of politics; indeed, I think I'm
      rather practical than otherwise, don't y' know. I am free to say, however,
      that I fear a worst result should those savages of a dinner-can and a
      dollar-a-day, succeed&mdash;really! You should think once in a while, and
      particularly in a beastly squall like the present, of the City itself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Should I?&rdquo; I returned. &ldquo;Now I'll let you into an organization tenet.
      Tammany, blow high, blow low, thinks only of itself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You would be given half the offices, remember.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And the Police?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And the Police.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tammany couldn't keep house without the police,&rdquo; said I, laughing.
      &ldquo;You've seen enough of our housekeeping to know that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You may have the police, and what else you will.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said I, bringing the talk to a close, &ldquo;I can't give you an answer
      now. I must look the situation in the eyes. To be frank, I don't think
      either the Tammany interest or my own runs with yours in this. I, with my
      people, live at the other end of the lane.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      While Morton and I were talking, I had come to a decision. I would name
      the reputable old gentleman for mayor. He was stricken of years; but I
      bethought me how for that very reason he might be, when elected, the
      easier to deal with. But I would keep my resolve from Morton. There was no
      stress of hurry; the election was months away. I might see reason to
      change. One should ever put off his contract-making until the last.
      Besides, Morton would feel the better for a surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before I went to an open alliance with the mugwumps, I would weaken the
      labor people. This I might do by pretending to be their friend. There was
      a strip of the labor candidate's support which was rabid anti-Tammany. Let
      me but seem to come to his comfort and aid, and every one of those would
      desert him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Within the week after my talk with Morton, I sent a sly scrap of news to
      the captains of labor. They were told that I had given utterance to
      sentiments of friendship for them and their man. Their taste to cultivate
      my support was set on edge. These amateurs of politics came seeking an
      interview. I flattered their hopes, and spoke in high terms of their
      candidate, his worth and honesty. The city could not be in safer hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      There were many interviews. It was as an experience, not without a side to
      amuse, since my visitors, while as pompous as turkey cocks, were as
      innocently shallow as so many sheep. Many times did we talk; and I gave
      them compliments and no promises.
    </p>
    <p>
      My ends were attained. The papers filled up with the coming partnership
      between the labor movement and the machine, and those berserks of
      anti-Tammany, frothing with resentment against ones who would sell
      themselves into my power as the price of my support, abandoned the
      laborites in a body. There were no fewer than five thousand of these to
      shake the dust of labor from their feet. When I had driven the last of
      them from the labor champion, by the simple expedient of appearing to be
      his friend, I turned decisively my back on him. Also, I at once called
      Tammany Convention&mdash;being the first in the field&mdash;and issued
      those orders which named the reputable old gentleman.
    </p>
    <p>
      There arose a roar and a cheer from my followers at this, for they read in
      that name a promise of money knee-deep; and what, than that word, should
      more brighten a Tammany eye! I was first, with the machine at my back, to
      walk upon the field with our reputable old gentleman. The mugwumps
      followed, adopting him with all dispatch; the Republicans, proper, made no
      ticket; two or three straggling cliques and split-offs of party accepted
      the reputable old gentleman's nomination; and so the lines were made. On
      the heels of the conventions, the mugwump leaders and I met and merged our
      tickets, I getting two-thirds and surrendering one-third of those names
      which followed that of the reputable old gentleman for the divers offices
      to be filled.
    </p>
    <p>
      When all was accomplished, the new situation offered a broad foundation,
      and one of solvency and depth, whereon to base a future for both Tammany
      and myself. It crystallized my power, and my grip on the machine was set
      fast and hard by the sheer effect of it. The next thing was to win at the
      polls; that would ask for studied effort and a quickness that must not
      sleep, for the opposition, while clumsy, straggling, and unwieldly with no
      skill, overtopped us in strength by every one of those thousands of which
      I had given Morton the name.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Really, you meant it should be a surprise,&rdquo; observed Morton, as he
      grasped my hand. It was the evening of the day on which the Tammany
      Convention named the reputable old gentleman. &ldquo;I'll plead guilty; it was a
      surprise. And that's saying a great deal, don't y' know. To be surprised
      is bad form, and naturally I guard myself against such a vulgar calamity.
      But you had me, old chap! I was never more baffled and beaten than when I
      left you. I regarded the conquest of the City by those barbarians as the
      thing made sure. Now all is changed. We will go in and win; and not a word
      I said, don't y' know, shall be forgotten and every dollar I mentioned
      shall be laid down. It shall, 'pon honor!&rdquo;

      machine was a training school for repeaters. Those ten thousand sent to
      our cause by Morton's friend, went about their work like artillerymen
      about their guns. Each was good for four votes. As one of the squad
      captains said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There's got to be time between, for a party to change his face an' shift
      to another coat an' hat. Besides, it's as well to give th' judges an hour
      or two to get dim to your mug, see!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Big Kennedy had set his foot upon the gang spirit, and stamped out of
      existence such coteries as the Tin Whistles and the Alley Gang, and I
      copied Big Kennedy in this. Such organizations would have been a threat to
      me, and put it more in reach of individual leaders to rebel against an
      order. What work had been done by the gangs was now, under a better
      discipline and with machine lines more tightly drawn, transacted by the
      police.
    </p>
    <p>
      When those skillful gentry, meant to multiply a ballot-total, came in from
      the South, I called my Chief of Police into council. He was that same
      bluff girthy personage who, aforetime, had conferred with Big Kennedy. I
      told him what was required, and how his men, should occasion arise, must
      foster as far as lay with them the voting purposes of our colonists.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You can rely on me, Gov'nor,&rdquo; said the Chief. He had invented this title
      for Big Kennedy, and now transferred it to me. &ldquo;Yes, indeed, you can go to
      sleep on me doin' my part. But I'm bothered to a standstill with my
      captains. Durin' th' last four or five years, th' force has become
      honeycombed with honesty; an', may I be struck! if some of them square
      guys aint got to be captains.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Should any get in your way,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;he must be sent to the outskirts. I
      shall hold you for everything that goes wrong.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I guess,&rdquo; said the Chief thoughtfully, &ldquo;I'll put the whole racket in
      charge of Gothecore. He'll keep your emigrants from Philadelphia walkin' a
      crack. They'll be right, while Gothecore's got his peeps on 'em.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Has Gothecore had experience?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is Bill Gothecore wise? Gov'nor, I don't want to paint a promise so
      brilliant I can't make good, but Gothecore is th' most thorough workman on
      our list. Why, they call him 'Clean Sweep Bill!' I put him in th'
      Tenderloin for six months, an' he got away with everything but th' back
      fence.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;the care of these colonists is in your hands. Here's
      a list of the places where they're berthed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You needn't give 'em another thought, Gov'nor,&rdquo; observed the Chief. Then,
      as he arose to depart: &ldquo;Somethin's got to be done about them captains
      turnin' square. They act as a scare to th' others. I'll tell you what:
      Make the price of a captaincy twenty thousand dollars. That'll be a hurdle
      no honest man can take. Whoever pays it, we can bet on as a member of our
      tribe. One honest captain queers a whole force; it's like a horse goin'
      lame.&rdquo; This last, moodily.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the eleventh hour, by our suggestion and at our cost, the Republican
      managers put up a ticket. This was made necessary by certain inveterate
      ones who would unite with nothing in which Tammany owned a part. As
      between us and the labor forces, they would have offered themselves to the
      latter. They must be given a ticket of their own whereon to waste
      themselves.
    </p>
    <p>
      The campaign itself was a whirlwind of money. That princely fund promised
      by Morton was paid down to me on the nail, and I did not stint or save it
      when a chance opened to advance our power by its employment. I say &ldquo;I did
      not stint,&rdquo; because, in accord with Tammany custom, the fund was wholly in
      my hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      As most men know, there is no such post as that of Chief of Tammany Hall.
      The office is by coinage, and the title by conference, of the public.
      There exists a finance committee of, commonly, a dozen names. It never
      meets, and the members in ordinary are 'to hear and know no more about the
      money of the organization than of sheep-washing among Ettrick's hills and
      vales. There is a chairman; into his hands all moneys come. These, in his
      care and name, and where and how and if he chooses, are put in bank. He
      keeps no books; he neither gives nor takes a scrap of paper, nor so much
      as writes a letter of thanks, in connection with such treasurership. He
      replies to no one for this money; he spends or keeps as he sees fit, and
      from beginning to end has the sole and only knowledge of either the intake
      or the outgo of the millions of the machine. The funds are wholly in his
      possession. To borrow a colloquialism, &ldquo;He is the Man with the Money,&rdquo; and
      since money is the mainspring of practical politics, it follows as the
      tail the kite, and without the intervention of either rule or statute,
      that he is The Boss. Being supreme with the money, he is supreme with the
      men of the machine, and it was the holding of this chairmanship which gave
      me my style and place as Chief.
    </p>
    <p>
      The position is not wanting in its rewards. Tammany, for its own safety,
      should come forth from each campaign without a dollar. There is no
      argument to carry over a residue from one battle to the next. It is not
      required, since Tammany, from those great corporations whose taxes and
      liberties it may extend or shrink by a word, may ever have what money it
      will; and it is not wise, because the existence of a fund between
      campaigns would excite dissension, as this leader or that one conceived
      some plan for its dissipation. It is better to upturn the till on the back
      of each election, and empty it in favor of organization peace. And to do
      this is the duty of the Chairman of the Finance Committee; and I may add
      that it is one he was never known to overlook.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was nothing notable in that struggle which sent the reputable old
      gentleman to the city fore as Mayor, beyond the energy wherewith the work
      required was performed. Every move ran off as softly sure as could be
      wished. The police did what they should. Those visitors from below turned
      in for us full forty thousand votes, and then quietly received their wages
      and as quietly went their way. I saw to it that, one and all, they were
      sharply aboard the ferryboats when their work was done. No one would care
      for them, drunken and mayhap garrulous, about the streets, until after the
      last spark of election interest had expired. The polls were closed: the
      count was made; the laborites and their Moses was beaten down, and the
      reputable old gentleman was declared victor by fifteen thousand. Those
      rich ones, late so pale, revived the color in their cheeks; and as for
      Tammany and myself, we took deep breaths, and felt as ones from whose
      shoulders a load had been lifted.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was for me a fortunate upcome; following that victory, my leadership
      could no more be shaken than may the full-grown oaks. Feeling now my
      strength, I made divers machine changes of the inner sort. I caused my
      executive leaders to be taken from the assembly districts, rather than
      from the wards. There would be one from each; and since there was a
      greater number of districts than wards, the executive array was increased.
      I smelled safety for myself in numbers, feeling, as Big Kennedy advised,
      the more secure with twenty than with two. Also the new situation gave the
      leaders less influence with the Aldermen, when now the frontiers of the
      one no longer matched those of the other. I had aimed at this; for it was
      my instant effort on becoming Chief to collect within my own fingers every
      last thread of possible authority. I wanted the voice of my leadership to
      be the voice of the storm; all others I would stifle to a whisper.
    </p>
    <p>
      While busy within the organization, deepening and broadening the channels
      of my power, I did not neglect conditions beyond the walls. I sent for the
      leaders of those two or three bands of Democracy which professed
      themselves opposed to Tammany Hall. I pitched upon my men as lumber folk
      in their log-driving pitch upon the key-logs in a &ldquo;jam.&rdquo; I loosened them
      with office, or the promise of it, and they instantly came riding down to
      me on the currents of self-interest, and brought with them those others
      over whom they held command.
    </p>
    <p>
      Within the twelvemonth Tammany was left no rival within the lines of the
      regular party; I had, either by purring or by purchase, brought about the
      last one's disappearance. It was a fair work for the machine, and I could
      feel the gathering, swelling confidence of my followers uplifting me as
      the deep sea uplifts a ship.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a thorn with that rose of leadership, nor did my hand escape its
      sting. The papers in their attacks upon me were as incessant as they were
      vindictive, and as unsparing as they were unfair. With never a fact set
      forth, by the word of these unmuzzled and uncaring imprints I stood forth
      as everything that was thievish, vile, and swart.
    </p>
    <p>
      While I made my skin as thick against these shafts as I could, since I
      might neither avoid nor return them, still they pierced me and kept me
      bleeding, and each new day saw ever a new wound to my sensibilities. It is
      a bad business&mdash;these storms of black abuse! You have but to fasten
      upon one, even an honest one, the name of horse-thief and, behold you! he
      will steal a horse. Moreover, those vilifications of types become arrows
      to glance aside and bury themselves in the breasts of ones innocent.

      Blossom was grown now to be a grave stripling girl of fifteen. Anne
      conceived that she should be taught in a school. She, herself, had carried
      Blossom to a considerable place in her books, but the finishing would be
      the better accomplished by teachers of a higher skill, and among children
      of Blossom's age. With this on her thought, Anne completed arrangements
      with a private academy for girls, one of superior rank; and to this shop
      of learning, on a certain morning, she conveyed Blossom. Blossom was to be
      fitted with a fashionable education by those modistes of the intellectual,
      just as a dressmaker might measure her, and baste her, and stitch her into
      a frock.
    </p>
    <p>
      But insult and acrid grief were lying there in ambush for Blossom&mdash;Blossom,
      then as ever, with her fear-haunted eyes. She was home before night,
      tearful, hysterical&mdash;crying in Anne's arms. There had been a cartoon
      in the papers. It showed me as a hairy brutal ape, the city in the shape
      of a beautiful woman fainting in my arms, and a mighty rock labeled
      &ldquo;Tammany&rdquo; in one hand, ready to hurl at my pursuers. The whole was
      hideous; and when one of the girls of the school showed it to Blossom, and
      taunted her with this portrait of her father, it was more than heart might
      bear. She fled before the outrage of it, and would never hear the name of
      school again. This ape-picture was the thing fearful and new to Blossom,
      for to save her, both Anne and I had been at care to have no papers to the
      house. The harm was done, however; Blossom, hereafter, would shrink from
      all but Anne and me, and when she was eighteen, save for us, the priest,
      and an old Galway serving woman who had been her nurse, she knew no one in
      the whole wide world.

      The reputable old gentleman made a most amazing Major. He was puffed with
      a vanity that kissed the sky. Honest, and by nature grateful, he was still
      so twisted as to believe that to be a good Mayor one must comport himself
      in an inhuman way.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Public office is a public trust!&rdquo; cried he, quoting some lunatic
      abstractionist.
    </p>
    <p>
      The reputable old gentleman's notion of discharging this trust was to
      refuse admittance to his friends, while he sat in council with his
      enemies. To show that he was independent, he granted nothing to ones who
      had builded him; to prove himself magnanimous, he went truckling to former
      foes, preferring them into place. As for me, he declined every suggestion,
      refused every name, and while there came no open rupture between us, I was
      quickly taught to stay away.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My luck with my father,&rdquo; said Morton, when one day we were considering
      that lofty spirit of the reputable old gentleman, &ldquo;is no more flattering
      than your own, don't y' know. He waves me away with a flourish. I reminded
      him that while he might forget me as one who with trowel and mortar had
      aided to lay the walls of his career, he at least should remember that I
      was none the less his son; I did, really! He retorted with the story of
      the Roman father who in his rôle as judge sentenced his son to death. Gad!
      he seemed to regret that no chance offered for him to equal though he
      might not surpass that noble example. Speaking seriously, when his term
      verges to its close, what will be your course? You know the old gentleman
      purposes to succeed himself. And, doubtless, since such is mugwump
      thickness, he'll be renominated.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tammany,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;will fight him. We'll have a candidate on a straight
      ticket of our own. His honor, your father, will be beaten.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On my soul! I hope so,&rdquo; exclaimed Morton. &ldquo;Don't you know, I expect every
      day to find him doing something to Mulberry Traction&mdash;trying to
      invalidate its franchise, or indulging in some similar piece of humor. I
      shall breathe easier with my parent returned to private life&mdash;really!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never fear; I'll have the city in the hollow of my hand within the year,&rdquo;
       said I.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will show you where to find a million or two in Wall Street, if you
      do,&rdquo; he returned.
    </p>
    <p>
      The downfall of the reputable old gentleman was already half accomplished.
      One by one, I had cut the props from beneath him. While he would grant me
      no contracts, and yield me no offices for my people, he was quite willing
      to consider my advice on questions of political concern. Having advantage
      of this, I one day pointed out that it was un-American to permit certain
      Italian societies to march in celebration of their victories over the Pope
      long ago. Why should good Catholic Irish-Americans be insulted with such
      exhibitions! These Italian festivals should be kept for Italy; they do not
      belong in America. The reputable old gentleman, who was by instinct more
      than half a Know Nothing, gave warm assent to my doctrines, and the
      festive Italians did not celebrate.
    </p>
    <p>
      Next I argued that the reputable old gentleman should refuse his
      countenance to the Irish exercises on St. Patrick's Day. The Irish were no
      better than the Italians. He could not make flesh of one and fish of the
      other. The reputable old gentleman bore testimony to the lucid beauty of
      my argument by rebuffing the Irish in a flame of words in which he doubted
      both their intelligence and their loyalty to the land of their adoption.
      In another florid tirade he later sent the Orangemen to the political
      right-about. The one powerful tribe he omitted to insult were the Germans,
      and that only because they did not come within his reach. Had they done
      so, the reputable old gentleman would have heaped contumely upon them with
      all the pleasure in life.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is not needed that I set forth how, while guiding the reputable old
      gentleman to these deeds of derring, I kept myself in the background. No
      one knew me as the architect of those wondrous policies. The reputable old
      gentleman stood alone; and in the inane fullness of his vanity took a deal
      of delight in the uproar he aroused.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was an enemy of my own. He was one of those elegant personalities
      who, in the elevation of riches and a position to which they are born,
      find the name of Tammany a synonym for crime. That man hated me, and hated
      the machine. But he loved the reputable old gentleman; and, by his name
      and his money, he might become of utmost avail to that publicist in any
      effort he put forth to have his mayorship again.
    </p>
    <p>
      One of the first offices of the city became vacant, that of chamberlain. I
      heard how the name of our eminent one would be presented for the place.
      That was my cue. I instantly asked that the eminent one be named for that
      vacant post of chamberlain. It was the earliest word which the reputable
      old gentleman had heard on the subject, for the friends of the eminent one
      as yet had not broached the business with him.
    </p>
    <p>
      When I urged the name of the eminent one, the reputable old gentleman
      pursed up his lips and frowned. He paused for so long a period that I
      began to fear lest he accept my suggestion. To cure such chance, I broke
      violently in upon his cogitations with the commands of the machine.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mark you,&rdquo; I cried, in the tones wherewith I was wont in former and
      despotic days to rule my Tin Whistles, &ldquo;mark you! there shall be no
      denial! I demand it in the name of Tammany Hall.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The sequel was what I sought; the reputable old gentleman elevated his
      crest. We straightway quarreled, and separated in hot dudgeon. When the
      select bevy who bore among them the name of the eminent one arrived upon
      the scene, the reputable old gentleman, metaphorically, shut the door in
      their faces. They departed in a rage, and the fires of their indignation
      were soon communicated to the eminent one.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the result of these various sowings, a nodding harvest of enemies
      sprung up to hate and harass the reputable old gentleman. I could tell
      that he would be beaten; he, with the most formidable forces of politics
      against him solid to a man! To make assurance sure, however, I secretly
      called to me the Chief of Police. In a moment, the quiet order was abroad
      to close the gambling resorts, enforce the excise laws against saloons,
      arrest every contractor violating the ordinances regulating building
      material in the streets, and generally, as well as specifically, to
      tighten up the town to a point that left folk gasping.
    </p>
    <p>
      No one can overrate the political effect of this. New York has no home. It
      sits in restaurants and barrooms day and night. It is a city of noisome
      tenements and narrow flats so small that people file themselves away
      therein like papers in a pigeonhole.
    </p>
    <p>
      These are not homes: they grant no comfort; men do not seek them until
      driven by want of sleep. It is for the cramped reasons of flats and
      tenements that New York is abroad all night. The town lives in the
      streets; or, rather, in those houses of refreshment which, open night and
      day, have thrown away their keys.
    </p>
    <p>
      This harsh enforcement of the excise law, or as Old Mike put it, &ldquo;Gettin'
      bechune th' people an' their beer,&rdquo; roused a wasps' nest of fifty thousand
      votes. The reputable old gentleman was to win the stinging benefit, since
      he, being chief magistrate, must stand the brunt as for an act of his
      administration.
    </p>
    <p>
      Altogether, politically speaking, my reputable old gentleman tossed and
      bubbled in a steaming kettle of fish when he was given his renomination.
      For my own side, I put up against him a noble nonentity with a historic
      name. He was a mere jelly-fish of principle&mdash;one whose boneless
      convictions couldn't stand on their own legs. If the town had looked at my
      candidate, it would have repudiated him with a howl. But I knew my public.
      New York votes with its back to the future. Its sole thought is to throw
      somebody out of office&mdash;in the present instance, the offensive
      reputable old gentleman&mdash;and this it will do with never a glance at
      that one who by the effect of the eviction is to be raised to the place.
      No, I had no apprehensions; I named my jelly-fish, and with a straight
      machine-made ticket, mine from truck to keel, shoved boldly forth. This
      time I meant to own the town.

      CHAPTER XVIII&mdash;HOW THE BOSS TOOK THE TOWN
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>HE reputable old
      gentleman was scandalized by what he called my defection, and told me so.
      That I should put up a ticket against him was grossest treason.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And why should I not?&rdquo; said I. &ldquo;You follow the flag of your interest; I
      but profit by your example.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sir!&rdquo; cried the reputable old gentleman haughtily, &ldquo;I have no interest
      save the interest of The public.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So you say,&rdquo; I retorted, &ldquo;and doubtless so you think.&rdquo; I had a desire to
      quarrel finally and for all time with the reputable old gentleman, whose
      name I no longer needed, and whose fame as an excise purist would now be
      getting in my way. &ldquo;You deceive yourself,&rdquo; I went on. &ldquo;Your prime motive
      is to tickle your own vanity with a pretense of elevation. From the
      pedestal of your millions, and the safe shelter of a clean white shirt,
      you patronize mankind and play the prig. That is what folk say of you. As
      to what obligation in your favor rests personally upon myself, I have only
      to recall your treatment of my candidate for that place of chamberlain.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you say men call me a prig?&rdquo; demanded the reputable old gentleman with
      an indignant start. He ignored his refusal of the eminent one as
      chamberlain.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sir, I deny the term 'prig.' If such were my celebration, I should not
      have waited to hear it from you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What should you hear or know of yourself?&rdquo; said I. &ldquo;The man looking from
      his window does not see his own house. He who marches with it, never sees
      the regiment of which he is a unit. No more can you, as mayor, see
      yourself, or estimate the common view concerning you. It is your vanity to
      seem independent and above control, and you have transacted that vanity at
      the expense of your friends. I've stood by while others went that road,
      and politically at least it ever led down hill.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      That was my last conference with the reputable old gentleman. I went back
      to Fourteenth Street, and called on my people of Tammany to do their
      utmost. Nor should I complain of their response, for they went behind
      their batteries with the cool valor of buccaneers.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was but one question which gave me doubt, and that was the question
      of the Australian ballot, then a novelty in our midst. Theretofore, a
      henchman of the machine went with that freeman to the ballot-box, and saw
      to it how he put no cheat upon his purchasers. Now our commissioners could
      approach a polls no nearer than two hundred feet; the freeman went in
      alone, took his folded ticket from the judges, retired to privacy and a
      pencil, and marked his ballot where none might behold the work. Who then
      could know that your mercenary, when thus removed from beneath one's eye
      and hand, would fight for one's side? I may tell you the situation was
      putting a wrinkle in my brow when Morton came lounging in.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know I've nothing to do with the old gentleman's campaign,&rdquo; said he,
      following a mouthful or two of commonplace, and puffing the while his
      usual cigarette. &ldquo;Gad! I told him that I had withdrawn from politics; I
      did, really! I said it was robbing me of all fineness; and that I must
      defend my native purity of sensibility, don't y' know, and preserve it
      from such sordid contact.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Father,' said I, 'you surely would not, for the small cheap glory of a
      second term, compel me into experiences that must leave me case-hardened
      in all that is spiritual?'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, he made no reply; simply turned his back upon me in merited contempt.
      Really, I think he was aware of me for a hypocrite. It was beastly hard to
      go back on the old boy, don't y' know! But for what I have in mind it was
      the thing to do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Now, when I had him to counsel with, I gave Morton my troubles over the
      Australian law. The situation, generally speaking, showed good; the more
      because there were three tickets in the field. Still, nothing was sure. We
      must work; and we must omit no usual means of adding to our strength. And
      the Australian law was in our way.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Really, you're quite right,&rdquo; observed Morton, polishing his eyeglass
      meditatively. &ldquo;To be sure, these beasts of burden, the labor element, have
      politically gone to pieces since our last campaign. But they are still
      wandering about by twos and threes, like so many lost sheep, and unless
      properly shepherded&mdash;and what a shepherd's crook is money!&mdash;they
      may fall into the mouths of opposition wolves, don't y' know. What
      exasperating dullards these working people are! I know of but one greater
      fool than the working man, and that is the fool he works for! And so you
      say this Australian law breeds uncertainty for our side?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is no way to tell how a man votes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Morton behind that potent eyeglass narrowed his gaze to the end of his
      nose, and gave a full minute to thought. Then his eyes, released from
      contemplation of his nose, began to brighten. I placed much reliance upon
      the fertility of our exquisite, for all his trumpery affectations of
      eyeglass and effeminate mannerisms, and I waited with impatience for him
      to speak.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Really, now,&rdquo; said he, at last, &ldquo;how many under the old plan would handle
      your money about each polling place?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;About four,&rdquo; I replied. &ldquo;Then at each polling booth there would be a
      dozen pullers-in, to bring up the voters, and go with them to see that
      they put in the right ballots. This last, you will notice, is by the
      Australian system made impossible.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is the duty of artillery people,&rdquo; drawled Morton, &ldquo;whenever the armor
      people invent a plate that cannot be perforated by guns in being, don't y'
      know, to at once invent a gun that shall pierce it. The same holds good in
      politics. Gad! we must invent a gun that shall knock a hole through this
      Australian armor; we must, really! A beastly system, I should call it,
      which those beggarly Australians have constructed! It's no wonder: they
      are all convicts down there, and it would need a felon to devise such an
      interference. However, this is what I suggest. You must get into your
      hands, we'll put it, five thousand of the printed ballots in advance of
      election day. This may be secretly done, don't y' know, by paying the
      printers where the tickets are being struck off. A printer is such an
      avaricious dog; he is, really! The tickets would be equally distributed
      among those men with the money whom you send about the polling places. A
      ballot in each instance should be marked with the cross for Tammany Hall
      before it is given to the recruit. He will then carry it into the booth in
      his pocket. Having received the regular ticket from the hands of the
      judges, he can go through the form of retiring, don't y' know; then
      reappear and give in the ticket which was marked by your man of the
      machine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And yet,&rdquo; said I breaking in, &ldquo;I do not see how you've helped the
      situation. The recruit might still vote the ticket handed him by the
      judges, for all our wisdom. Moreover, it would be no easy matter to get
      hold of fifty thousand tickets, all of which we would require to make
      sure. Five thousand we might manage, but that would not be enough.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You should let me finish; you should, really!&rdquo; returned Morton. &ldquo;One
      would not pay the recruit until he returned to that gentleman of finance
      with whom he was dealing, don't y' know, and put into his hands the
      unmarked ballot with which the judges had endowed him. That would prove
      his integrity; and it would also equip your agent with a new fresh ballot
      against the next recruit. Thus you would never run out of ballots. Gad! I
      flatter myself, I've hit upon an excellent idea, don't y' know!&rdquo; and with
      that, Morton began delicately to caress his mustache, again taking on his
      masquerade of the ineffably inane.
    </p>
    <p>
      Morton's plan was good; I saw its merits in a flash. He had proposed a
      sure system by which the machine might operate in spite of that antipodean
      law. We used it too, and it was half the reason of our victory. Upon its
      proposal, I extended my compliments to Morton.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Really, it's nothing,&rdquo; said he, as though the business bored him. &ldquo;Took
      the hint from football, don't y' know. It is a rule of that murderous
      amusement, when you can't buck the center, to go around the ends. But I
      must have a ride in the park to rest me; I must, really! I seldom permit
      myself to think&mdash;it's beastly bad form to think&mdash;and, therefore,
      when I do give my intelligence a canter, it fatigues me beyond expression.
      Well, good-by! I shall see you when I am recuperated. Meanwhile, you must
      not let that awful parent of mine succeed; it would be our ruin, don't y'
      know!&rdquo; and Morton glared idiotically behind the eyeglass at the thought of
      the reputable old gentleman flourishing through a second term. &ldquo;Yes,
      indeed,&rdquo; he concluded, &ldquo;the old boy would become a perfect juggernaut!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Morton's plan worked to admiration. The mercenary was given a ballot,
      ready marked; and later he returned with the one which the judges gave
      him, took his fee, and went his way.
    </p>
    <p>
      In these days, when the ballot furnished, by the judges is stamped on the
      back, each with its separate number in red ink, which number is set
      opposite a voter's name at the time he receives the ballot, and all to be
      verified when he brings it again to the judges for deposit in the box, the
      scheme would be valueless. There lies no open chance for the substitution
      of a ready-made ballot, because of the deterrent number in red ink.
    </p>
    <p>
      Under these changed conditions, however, as Morton declared they must, the
      gunners of party have invented both the projectile and the rifle to pierce
      this new and stronger plate. The party emblems, the Eagle, the Star, the
      Ship, and other totems of partisanship, are printed across the head of the
      ticket in black accommodating ink. The recruit now makes his designating
      cross with a pencil that is as soft as fresh paint. Then he spreads over
      the head of the ticket, as he might a piece of blotting paper, a tissue
      sheet peculiarly prepared. A gentle rub of the fingers across the tissue,
      stains it plainly with the Eagle, the Star, the Ship, and the entire
      procession of totems; also, it takes with the rest an impression of that
      penciled cross. This tissue, our recruit brings to that particular
      paymaster of the forces with whom he is in barter, and a glance answers
      the query was the vote made right or wrong. If &ldquo;right&rdquo; the recruit has his
      reward; if &ldquo;wrong,&rdquo; he is spurned from the presence as one too densely
      ignorant to be of use.
    </p>
    <p>
      The reputable old gentleman, when the vote came on, was overpowered; he
      retired to private life, inveighing against republics for that they were
      ungrateful. My jelly-fish of historic blood took his place as mayor, and
      Tammany dominated every corner of the town. My word was absolute from the
      bench of the jurist to the beat of the policeman; the second greatest city
      in the world, with every dollar of its treasure, was in my hands to do
      with it as I would. I drew a swelling sense of comfort from the situation
      which my breast had never known.
    </p>
    <p>
      And yet, I was not made mad by this sudden grant of power. I knew by the
      counsel of Big Kennedy, and the dungeon fate of that Boss who was
      destroyed, that I must light a lamp of caution for my journeyings. Neither
      the rôle of bully, nor the bluff method of the highwayman, would serve; in
      such rough event, the people, overhanging all, would be upon one like an
      avalanche. One must proceed by indirection and while the common back was
      turned; one, being careful, might bleed the public while it slept.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the town in its threads was thus wholly in my hands, with every
      office, great or small, held by a man of the machine, Morton came to call
      upon me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And so you're the Czar!&rdquo; said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have the enemy's word for it,&rdquo; I replied. &ldquo;'Czar' is what they call
      me in their papers when they do not call me 'rogue.'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mere compliments, all,&rdquo; returned Morton airily. &ldquo;Really, I should feel
      proud to be thus distinguished. And yet I'm surprised! I was just telling
      an editor of one of our rampant dailies: 'Can't you see,' said I, 'that he
      who speaks ill of his master speaks ill of himself? To call a man a
      scoundrel or an ignoramus, is to call him weak, since neither is a mark of
      strength. And when you term him scoundrel and ignoramus who has beaten
      you, you but name yourself both viler, weaker still. Really,' I concluded,
      'if only to preserve one's own standing, one should ever speak well of
      one's conqueror, don't y' know!' But it was of no use; that ink-fellow
      merely scowled and went his way. However, to discuss a theory of epithet
      was not my present purpose. Do you recall how, on the edge of the
      campaign, I said that if you would but win the town I'd lead you into
      millions?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;you said something of the sort.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must trust me in this: I understand the market better than you do,
      don't y' know. Perhaps you have noticed that Blackberry Traction is very
      low&mdash;down to ninety, I think?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; I replied, &ldquo;the thing is news to me. I know nothing of stocks.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's as well. This, then, is my road to wealth for both of us. As a first
      move, don't y' know, and as rapidly as I can without sending it up, I
      shall load myself for our joint account with we'll say&mdash;since I'm
      sure I can get that much&mdash;forty thousand shares of Blackberry. It
      will take me ten days. When I'm ready, the president of Blackberry will
      call upon you; he will, really! He will have an elaborate plan for
      extending Blackberry to the northern limits of the town; and he will ask,
      besides, for a half-dozen cross-town franchises to act as feeders to the
      main line, and to connect it with the ferries. Be slow and thoughtful with
      our Blackberry president, but encourage him. Gad! keep him coming to you
      for a month, and on each occasion seem nearer to his view. In the end,
      tell him he can have those franchises&mdash;cross-town and extensions&mdash;and,
      for your side, go about the preliminary orders to city officers. It will
      send Blackberry aloft like an elevator, don't y' know! Those forty
      thousand shares will go to one hundred and thirty-five&mdash;really!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Two weeks later Morton gave me the quiet word that he held for us a trifle
      over forty thousand shares of Blackberry which he had taken at an average
      of ninety-one. Also, he had so intrigued that the Blackberry's president
      would seek a meeting with me to consider those extensions, and discover my
      temper concerning them.
    </p>
    <p>
      The president of Blackberry and I came finally together in a parlor of the
      Hoffman House, as being neutral ground. I found him soft-voiced,
      plausible, with a Hebrew cast and clutch. He unfurled his blue-prints,
      which showed the proposed extensions, and what grants of franchises would
      be required.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the beginning, I was cold, doubtful; I distrusted a public approval of
      the grants, and feared the public's resentment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tammany must retain the people's confidence,&rdquo; said I. &ldquo;It can only do so
      by protecting jealously the people's interests.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The president of Blackberry shrugged his shoulders. He looked at me hard,
      and as one who waited for my personal demands. He would not speak, but
      paused for me to begin. I could feel it in the air how a halfmillion might
      be mine for the work of asking. I never said the word, however; I had no
      mind to put my hand into that dog's mouth.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus we stood; he urging, I considering the advisability of those
      asked-for franchises. This was our attitude throughout a score of
      conferences, and little by little I went leaning the Blackberry way.
    </p>
    <p>
      To be sure, the secret of our meetings was whispered in right quarters,
      and every day found fresh buyers for Blackberry. Meanwhile, the shares
      climbed high and ever higher, until one bland April morning they stood at
      one hundred and thirty-seven.
    </p>
    <p>
      Throughout my series of meetings with the president of Blackberry, I had
      seen no trace of Morton. For that I cared nothing, but played my part
      slowly so as to give him time, having confidence in his loyalty, and
      knowing that my interest was his interest, and I in no sort to be worsted.
      On that day when Blackberry showed at one hundred and thirty-seven, Morton
      appeared. He laid down a check for an even million of dollars.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I've been getting out of Blackberry for a week,&rdquo; said he, with his air of
      delicate lassitude. &ldquo;I found that it was tiring me, don't y' know; I did
      really! Besides, we've done enough: No gentlemen ever makes more than one
      million on a single turn; it's not good form.&rdquo; That check, drawn to my
      order, was the biggest of its kind I'd ever handled. I took it up, and I
      could feel a pringling to my finger-ends with the contact of so much
      wealth all mine. I envied my languid friend his genius for coolness and
      aplomb. He selected a cigarette, and lighted it as though a million here
      and there, on a twist of the market, was a commonest of affairs. When I
      could command my voice, I said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And now I suppose we may give Blackberry its franchises?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, not yet,&rdquo; returned Morton. &ldquo;Really, we're not half through. I've not
      only gotten rid of our holdings, but I've sold thirty-five thousand shares
      the other way. It was a deuced hard thing to do without sending the stock
      off&mdash;the market is always so beastly ready to tumble, don't y' know.
      But I managed it; we're now short about thirty-five thousand shares at one
      hundred and thirty-seven.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What then?&rdquo; said I.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On the whole,&rdquo; continued Morton, with just a gleam of triumph behind his
      eyeglass, &ldquo;on the whole, I think I should refuse Blackberry, don't y'
      know. The public interest would be thrown away; and gad! the people are
      prodigiously moved over it already, they are, really! It would be neither
      right nor safe. I'd come out in an interview declaring that a grant of
      what Blackberry asks for would be to pillage the town. Here, I've the
      interview prepared. What do you say? Shall we send it to the <i>Daily Tory</i>?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The interview appeared; Blackberry fell with a crash. It slumped fifty
      points, and Morton and I were each the better by fairly another million.
      Blackberry grazed the reef of a receivership so closely that it rubbed the
      paint from its side.

      CHAPTER XIX&mdash;THE SON OF THE WIDOW VAN FLANGE
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">W</span>HEN now I was rich
      with double millions, I became harrowed of new thoughts and sown with new
      ambitions. It was Blossom to lie at the roots of it&mdash;Blossom, looking
      from her window of young womanhood upon a world she did not understand,
      and from which she drew away. The world was like a dark room to Blossom,
      with an imagined fiend to harbor in every corner of it. She must go forth
      among people of manners and station. The contact would mend her shyness;
      with time and usage she might find herself a pleasant place in life. Now
      she lived a morbid creature of sorrow which had no name&mdash;a twilight
      soul of loneliness&mdash;and the thought of curing this went with me day
      and night.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nor was I unjustified of authority.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Send your daughter into society,&rdquo; said that physician to whom I put the
      question. &ldquo;It will be the true medicine for her case. It is her nerves
      that lack in strength; society, with its dinners and balls and fêtes and
      the cheerful hubbub of drawing rooms, should find them exercise, and
      restore them to a complexion of health.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Anne did not believe with that savant of nerves. She distrusted my society
      plans for Blossom.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You think they will taunt her with the fact of me,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;like that
      one who showed her the ape cartoon as a portrait of her father. But
      Blossom is grown a woman now. Those whom I want her to meet would be made
      silent by politeness, even if nothing else might serve to stay their
      tongues from such allusions. And I think she would be loved among them,
      for she is good and beautiful, and you of all should know how she owns to
      fineness and elevation.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But it is not her nature,&rdquo; pleaded Anne. &ldquo;Blossom would be as much hurt
      among those men and women of the drawing rooms as though she walked,
      barefooted, over flints.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      For all that Anne might say, I persisted in my resolve. Blossom must be
      saved against herself by an everyday encounter with ones of her own age. I
      had more faith than Anne. There must be kindness and sympathy in the
      world, and a countenance for so much goodness as Blossom's. Thus she
      should find it, and the discovery would let in the sun upon an existence
      now overcast with clouds.
    </p>
    <p>
      These were my reasonings. It would win her from her broodings and those
      terrors without cause, which to my mind were a kind of insanity that might
      deepen unless checked.
    </p>
    <p>
      Full of my great design, I moved into a new home&mdash;a little palace in
      its way, and one to cost me a penny. I cared nothing for the cost; the
      house was in the center of that region of the socially select. From this
      fine castle of gilt, Blossom should conquer those alliances which were to
      mean so much for her good happiness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Being thus fortunately founded, I took Morton into my confidence. He was a
      patrician by birth and present station; and I knew I might have both his
      hand and his wisdom for what was in my heart. When I laid open my thought
      to Morton, he stood at gaze like one planet-struck, while that inevitable
      eyeglass dropped from his amazed nose.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must pardon my staring,&rdquo; said he, at last. &ldquo;It was a beastly rude
      thing to do. But, really, don't y' know, I was surprised that one of force
      and depth, and who was happily outside society, should find himself so
      badly guided as to seek to enter it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You, yourself, are in its midst.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That should be charged,&rdquo; he returned, &ldquo;to accident rather than design. I
      am in the midst of society, precisely as some unfortunate tree might be
      found in the middle of its native swamp, and only because being born there
      I want of that original energy required for my transplantation. I will say
      this,&rdquo; continued Morton, getting up to walk the floor; &ldquo;your introduction
      into what we'll style the Four Hundred, don't y' know, might easily be
      brought about. You have now a deal of wealth; and that of itself should be
      enough, as the annals of our Four Hundred offer ample guaranty. But more
      than that, stands the argument of your power, and how you, in your
      peculiar fashion, are unique. Gad, for the latter cause alone, swelldom
      would welcome you with spread arms; it would, really! But believe me, if
      it were happiness you came seeking you would miss it mightily. There is
      more laughter in Third Avenue than in Fifth.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But it is of my Blossom I am thinking,&rdquo; I cried. &ldquo;For myself I am not so
      ambitious.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what should your daughter,&rdquo; said Morton, &ldquo;find worth her young while
      in society? She is, I hear from you, a girl of sensibility. That true, she
      would find nothing but disappointment in this region you think so select.
      Do you know our smart set? Sir, it is composed of savages in silk.&rdquo;
       Morton, I found, had much the manner of his father, when stirred. &ldquo;It is,&rdquo;
       he went on, &ldquo;that circle where discussion concerns itself with nothing
      more onerous than golf or paper-chases or singlestickers or polo or balls
      or scandals; where there is no literature save the literature of the
      bankbook; where snobs invent a pedigree and play at caste; where folk give
      lawn parties to dogs and dinners to which monkeys come as guests of honor;
      where quarrels occur over questions of precedence between a mosquito and a
      flea; where pleasure is a trade, and idleness an occupation; in short, it
      is that place where the race, bruised of riches, has turned cancerous and
      begun to rot.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You draw a vivid picture,&rdquo; said I, not without a tincture of derision.
      &ldquo;For all that, I stick by my determination, and ask your help. I tell you
      it is my daughter's life or death.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Morton, at this, relapsed into his customary attitude of moral, mental
      Lah-de-dah, and his lisp and his drawl and his eyeglass found their usual
      places. He shrugged his shoulders in his manner of the superfine.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why then,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;and seeing that you will have no other way for it,
      you may command my services. Really, I shall be proud to introduce you,
      don't y' know, as one who, missing being a monkey by birth, is now
      determined to become one by naturalization. Now I should say that a way to
      begin would be to discover a dinner and have you there as a guest. I know
      a society queen who will jump at the chance; she will have you at her
      chariot wheel like another Caractacus in another Rome, and parade you as a
      latest captive to her social bow and spear. I'll tell her; it will offer
      an excellent occasion for you to declare your intentions and take out your
      first papers in that Apeland whereof you seem so strenuous to become a
      citizen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      While the work put upon me by my place as Boss had never an end, but
      filled both my day and my night to overflowing, it brought with it
      compensation. If I were ground and worn away on the wheel of my position
      like a knife on a grindstone, still I was kept to keenest edge, and I felt
      that joy I've sometimes thought a good blade must taste in the sheer fact
      of its trenchant quality. Besides, there would now and then arrive a
      moment which taught me how roundly I had conquered, and touched me with
      that sense of power which offers the highest pleasure whereof the soul of
      man is capable. Here would be an example of what I mean, although I cannot
      believe the thing could happen in any country save America or any city
      other than New York.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was one evening at my own door, when that judge who once sought to fix
      upon me the murder of Jimmy the Blacksmith, came tapping for an interview.
      His term was bending towards the evening of its close, and the mean
      purpose of him was none better-than to just plead for his place again. I
      will not say the man was abject; but then the thought of his mission,
      added to a memory of that relation to each other in which it was aforetime
      our one day's fate to have stood, choked me with contempt. I shall let his
      conduct go by without further characterization; and yet for myself, had
      our fortunes been reversed and he the Boss and I the Judge, before I had
      been discovered in an attitude of office-begging from a hand I once
      plotted to kill, I would have died against the wall. But so it was; my
      visitor would labor with me for a renomination.
    </p>
    <p>
      My first impulse was one of destruction; I would put him beneath the wheel
      and crush out the breath of his hopes. And then came Big Kennedy's warning
      to avoid revenge when moved of nothing broader than a reason of revenge.
    </p>
    <p>
      I sat and gazed mutely upon that judge for a space; he, having told his
      purpose, awaited my decision without more words. I grew cool, and cunning
      began to have the upper hand of violence in my breast. If I cast him down,
      the papers would tell of it for the workings of my vengeance. If, on the
      quiet other hand, he were to be returned, it would speak for my
      moderation, and prove me one who in the exercise of power lifted himself
      above the personal. I resolved to continue him; the more since the longer
      I considered, the clearer it grew that my revenge, instead of being
      starved thereby, would find in it a feast.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You tried to put a rope about my neck,&rdquo; said I at last.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was misled as to the truth.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Still you put a stain upon me. There be thousands who believe me guilty
      of bloodshed, and of that you shall clear me by printed word.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am ever ready to repair an error.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Within a week, with black ink and white paper, my judge in peril set forth
      how since my trial he had gone to the ends of that death of Jimmy the
      Blacksmith in its history. I was, he said, an innocent man, having had
      neither part nor lot therein.
    </p>
    <p>
      I remember that over the glow of triumph wherewith I read his words, there
      came stealing the chill shadow of a hopeless grief. Those phrases of
      exoneration would not recall poor Apple Cheek; nor would they restore
      Blossom to that poise and even balance from which she had been shaken on a
      day before her birth. For all the sorrow of it, however, I made good my
      word; and I have since thought that whether our judge deserved the place
      or no, to say the least he earned it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Every man has his model, and mine was Big John Kennedy. This was in a way
      of nature, for I had found Big Kennedy in my boyhood, and it is then, and
      then only, when one need look for his great men. When once you have grown
      a beard, you will meet with few heroes, and make to yourself few friends;
      wherefore you should the more cherish those whom your fortunate youth has
      furnished.
    </p>
    <p>
      Big Kennedy was my exemplar, and there arose few conditions to frown upon
      me with a problem to be solved, when I did not consider what Big Kennedy
      would have done in the face of a like contingency. Nor was I to one side
      of the proprieties in such a course. Now, when I glance backward down that
      steep aisle of endeavor up which I've come, I recall occasions, and some
      meant for my compliment, when I met presidents, governors, grave jurists,
      reverend senators, and others of tallest honors in the land. They talked
      and they listened, did these mighty ones; they gave me their views and
      their reasons for them, and heard mine in return; and all as equal might
      encounter equal in a commerce of level terms. And yet, choose as I may, I
      have not the name of him who in a pure integrity of force, or that wisdom
      which makes men follow, was the master of Big John Kennedy. My old chief
      won all his wars within the organization, and that is the last best test
      of leadership. He made no backward steps, but climbed to a final supremacy
      and sustained himself. I was justified in steering by Big Kennedy. Respect
      aside, I would have been wrecked had I not done so. That man who essays to
      live with no shining example to show his feet the path, is as one who
      wanting a lantern, and upon a moonless midnight, urges abroad into regions
      utterly unknown.
    </p>
    <p>
      Not alone did I observe those statutes for domination which Big Kennedy
      both by precept and example had given me, but I picked up his alliances;
      and that one was the better in my eyes, and came to be observed with wider
      favor, who could tell of a day when he carried Big Kennedy's confidence.
      It was a brevet I always honored with my own.
    </p>
    <p>
      One such was the Reverend Bronson, still working for the regeneration of
      the Five Points, He often came to me for money or countenance in his
      labors, and I did ever as Big Kennedy would have done and heaped up the
      measure of his requests.
    </p>
    <p>
      It would seem, also, that I had more of the acquaintance of this good man
      than had gone to my former leader. For one thing, we were more near in
      years, and then, too, I have pruned my language of those slangy rudenesses
      of speech which loaded the conversation of Big Kennedy, and cultivated in
      their stead softness and a verbal cleanliness which put the Reverend
      Bronson at more ease in my company. I remember with what satisfaction I
      heard him say that he took me for a person of education.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was upon a time when I had told him of my little learning; for the
      gloom of it was upon me constantly, and now and then I would cry out
      against it, and speak of it as a burden hard to bear. I shall not soon
      forget the real surprise that showed in the Reverend Bronson's face, nor
      yet the good it did me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You amaze me!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;Now, from the English you employ I should not
      have guessed it. Either my observation is dulled, or you speak as much by
      grammar as do I, who have seen a college.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This was true by more than half, since like many who have no glint of
      letters, and burning with the shame of it, I was wont to listen closely to
      the talk of everyone learned of books; and in that manner, and by
      imitation, I taught myself a decent speech just as a musician might catch
      a tune by ear.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Still I have no education,&rdquo; I said, when the Reverend Bronson spoke of
      his surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you have, though,&rdquo; returned he, &ldquo;only you came by that education not
      in the common way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      That good speech alone, and the comfort of it to curl about my heart, more
      than repaid me for all I ever did or gave by request of the Reverend
      Bronson; and it pleases me to think I told him so. But I fear I set down
      these things rather in vanity than to do a reader service, and before
      patience turns fierce with me, I will get onward with my story.
    </p>
    <p>
      One afternoon the Reverend Bronson came leading a queer bedraggled boy,
      whose years&mdash;for all he was stunted and beneath a size&mdash;should
      have been fourteen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can't you find something which this lad may do?&rdquo; asked the Reverend
      Bronson. &ldquo;He has neither father nor mother nor home&mdash;he seems utterly
      friendless. He has no capacity, so far as I have sounded him, and, while
      he is possessed of a kind of animal sharpness, like the sharpness of a
      hawk or a weasel, I can think of nothing to set him about by which he
      could live. Even the streets seem closed to him, since the police for some
      reason pursue him and arrest him on sight. It was in a magistrate's court
      I found him. He had been dragged there by an officer, and would have been
      sent to a reformatory if I had not rescued him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And would not that have been the best place for him?&rdquo; I asked, rather to
      hear the Reverend Bronson's reply, than because I believed in my own
      query. Aside from being a born friend of liberty in a largest sense, my
      own experience had not led me to believe that our reformatories reform.
      I've yet to hear of him who was not made worse by a term in any prison.
      &ldquo;Why not send him to a reformatory?&rdquo; said I again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No one should be locked up,&rdquo; contended the Reverend Bronson, &ldquo;who has not
      shown himself unfit to be free. That is not this boy's case, I think; he
      has had no chance; the police, according to that magistrate who gave him
      into my hands, are relentless against him, and pick him up on sight.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And are not the police good judges of these matters?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I would not trust their judgment,&rdquo; returned the Reverend Bronson. &ldquo;There
      are many noble men upon the rolls of the police.&rdquo; Then, with a doubtful
      look: &ldquo;For the most part, however, I should say they stand at the head of
      the criminal classes, and might best earn their salaries by arresting
      themselves.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At this, I was made to smile, for it showed how my reverend visitor's
      years along the Bowery had not come and gone without lending him some
      saltiness of wit.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Leave the boy here,&rdquo; said I at last, &ldquo;I'll find him work to live by, if
      it be no more than sitting outside my door, and playing the usher to those
      who call upon me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Melting Moses is the only name he has given me,&rdquo; said the Reverend
      Bronson, as he took his leave. &ldquo;I suppose, if one might get to it, that he
      has another.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Melting Moses, as a name, should do very well,&rdquo; said I.
    </p>
    <p>
      Melting Moses looked wistfully after the Reverend Bronson when the latter
      departed, and I could tell by that how the urchin regretted the going of
      the dominie as one might regret the going of an only friend. Somehow, the
      lad's forlorn state grew upon me, and I made up my mind to serve as his
      protector for a time at least. He was a shrill child of the Bowery, was
      Melting Moses, and spoke a kind of gutter dialect, one-half slang and the
      other a patter of the thieves that was hard to understand. My first
      business was to send him out with the janitor of the building to have him
      thrown into a bathtub, and then buttoned into a new suit of clothes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Melting Moses submitted dumbly to these improvements, being rather
      resigned than pleased, and later with the same docility went home to sleep
      at the janitor's house. Throughout the day he would take up his post on my
      door and act as herald to what visitors might come.
    </p>
    <p>
      Being washed and combed and decently arrayed, Melting Moses, with black
      eyes and a dark elfin face, made no bad figure of a boy. For all his
      dwarfishness, I found him surprisingly strong, and as active as a monkey.
      He had all the love and loyalty of a collie for me, and within the first
      month of his keeping my door, he would have cast himself into the river if
      I had asked him for that favor.
    </p>
    <p>
      Little by little, scrap by scrap, Melting Moses gave me his story. Put
      together in his words, it ran like this:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Me fadder kept a joint in Kelly's Alley; d' name of-d' joint was d' Door
      of Death, see! It was a hot number, an' lots of trouble got pulled off
      inside. He used to fence for d' guns an' dips, too, me fadder did; an'
      w'en one of 'em nipped a super or a rock, an' wanted d' quick dough, he
      brought it to me fadder, who chucked down d' stuff an' no questions asked.
      One day a big trick comes off&mdash;a jooeler's winder or somet'ing like
      dat. Me fadder is in d' play from d' outside, see! An' so w'en dere's a
      holler, he does a sneak an' gets away, 'cause d' cops is layin' to pinch
      him. Me fadder gets put wise to this be a mug who hangs out about d'
      Central Office. He sherries like I says.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At dat, d' Captain who's out to nail me fadder toins sore all t'rough.
      W'en me fadder sidesteps into New Joisey or some'ers, d' Captain sends
      along a couple of his harness bulls from Mulberry Street, an' dey pinches
      me mudder, who aint had nothin' to do wit' d' play at all. Dey rings for
      d' hurry-up wagon, an' takes me mudder to d' station. D' Captain he gives
      her d' eye, an' asts where me fadder is. She says she can't put him on,
      'cause she aint on herself. Wit' dat, dis Captain t'rows her d' big chest,
      see! an' says he'll give her d' t'ree degrees if she don't cough up d'
      tip. But she hands him out d' old gag: she aint on. So then, d' Captain
      has her put in a cell; an' nothin' to eat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;After d' foist night he brings her up ag'in.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Dat's d' number one d'gree,' says he.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But still me mudder don't tell, 'cause she can't. Me fadder aint such a
      farmer as to go leavin' his address wit' no one.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;D' second night dey keeps me mudder in a cell, an' toins d' hose on d'
      floor so she can't do nothin' but stan' 'round&mdash;no sleep! no chuck!
      no nothin'!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Dat's d' number two d'gree,' says d' bloke of a Captain to me mudder.
      'Now where did dat husband of yours skip to?'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But me mudder couldn't tell.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Give d' old goil d' dungeon,' says d' Captain; 'an' t'row her in a brace
      of rats to play wit'.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An' now dey locks me mudder in a place like a cellar, wit' two rats to
      squeak an' scrabble about all night, an' t'row a scare into her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An' it would too, only she goes dotty.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Next day, d' Captain puts her in d' street. But w'at's d' use? She's off
      her trolley. She toins sick; an' in a week she croaks. D' sawbones gets
      her for d' colleges.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Melting Moses shed tears at this.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dat's about all,&rdquo; he concluded. &ldquo;W'en me mudder was gone, d' cops toined
      in to do me. D' Captain said he was goin' to clean up d' fam'ly; so he
      gives d' orders, an' every time I'd show up on d' line, I'd get d' collar.
      It was one of dem times, w'en d' w'itechoker, who passes me on to you,
      gets his lamps on me an' begs me off from d' judge, see!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Melting Moses wept a deal during his relation, and I was not without being
      moved by it myself. I gave the boy what consolation I might, by assuring
      him that he was safe with me, and that no policeman should threaten him. A
      tale of trouble, and particularly if told by a child, ever had power to
      disturb me, and I did not question Melting Moses concerning his father and
      mother a second time.
    </p>
    <p>
      My noble nonentity&mdash;for whom I will say that he allowed me to finger
      him for offices and contracts, as a musician fingers the keyboard of a
      piano, and play upon him what tunes of profit I saw fit&mdash;was mayor,
      and the town wholly in my hands, with a Tammany man in every office, when
      there occurred the first of a train of events which in their passage were
      to plow a furrow in my life so deep that all the years to come after have
      not served to smooth it away. I was engaged at my desk, when Melting Moses
      announced a caller.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She's a dame in black,&rdquo; said Melting Moses; &ldquo;an' she's of d' Fift' Avenoo
      squeeze all right.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Melting Moses, now he was fed and dressed, went through the days with
      uncommon spirit, and when not thinking on his mother would be gay enough.
      My visitors interested him even more than they did me, and he announced
      but few without hazarding his surmise as to both their origins and their
      errands.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Show her in!&rdquo; I said.
    </p>
    <p>
      My visitor was a widow, as I could see by her mourning weeds. She was past
      middle life; gray, with hollow cheeks, and sad pleading eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My name is Van Flange,&rdquo; said she. &ldquo;The Reverend Bronson asked me to call
      upon you. It's about my son; he's ruining us by his gambling.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then the Widow Van Flange told of her son's infatuation; and how blacklegs
      in Barclay Street were fleecing him with roulette and faro bank.
    </p>
    <p>
      I listened to her story with patience. While I would not find it on my
      programme to come to her relief, I aimed at respect for one whom the
      Reverend Bronson had endorsed. I was willing to please that good man, for
      I liked him much since he spoke in commendation of my English. Besides, if
      angered, the Reverend Bronson would be capable of trouble. He was too
      deeply and too practically in the heart of the East Side; he could not
      fail to have a tale to tell that would do Tammany Hall no good, but only
      harm. Wherefore, I in no wise cut short the complaints of the Widow Van
      Flange. I heard her to the end, training my face to sympathy the while,
      and all as though her story were not one commonest of the town.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You may be sure, madam,&rdquo; said I, when the Widow Van Flange had finished,
      &ldquo;that not only for the Reverend Bronson's sake, but for your own, I shall
      do all I may to serve you. I own no personal knowledge of that gambling
      den of which you speak, nor of those sharpers who conduct it. That
      knowledge belongs with the police. The number you give, however, is in
      Captain Gothecore's precinct. We'll send for him if you'll wait.&rdquo; With
      that I rang my desk bell for Melting Moses. &ldquo;Send for Captain Gothecore,&rdquo;
       said I. At the name, the boy's black eyes flamed up in a way to puzzle.
      &ldquo;Send a messenger for Captain Gothecore; I want him at once.&rdquo;

      CHAPTER XX&mdash;THE MARK OF THE ROPE
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">W</span>HILE the Widow Van
      Flange and I sat waiting the coming of Gothecore, the lady gave me further
      leaves of her story. The name of Van Flange was old. It had been honorable
      and high in the days of Wouter Van Twiller, and when the town was called
      New Amsterdam. The Van Flanges had found their source among the wooden
      shoes and spinning-wheels of the ancient Dutch, and were duly proud. They
      had been rich, but were now reduced, counting&mdash;she and her boy&mdash;no
      more than two hundred thousand dollars for their fortune.
    </p>
    <p>
      This son over whom she wept was the last Van Flange; there was no one
      beyond him to wear the name. To the mother, this made his case the more
      desperate, for mindful of her caste, she was borne upon by pride of family
      almost as much as by maternal love. The son was a drunkard; his taste for
      alcohol was congenital, and held him in a grip that could not be unloosed.
      And he was wasting their substance; what small riches remained to them
      were running away at a rate that would soon leave nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But why do you furnish him money?&rdquo; said I.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You should keep him without a penny.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;True!&rdquo; responded the Widow Van Flange, &ldquo;but those who pillage my son have
      found a way to make me powerless. There is a restaurant near this gambling
      den. The latter, refusing him credit and declining his checks, sends him
      always to this restaurant-keeper. He takes my son's check, and gives him
      the money for it. I know the whole process,&rdquo; concluded the Widow Van
      Flange, a sob catching in her throat, &ldquo;for I've had my son watched, to see
      if aught might be done to save him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But those checks,&rdquo; I observed, &ldquo;should be worthless, for you have told me
      how your son has no money of his own.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And that is it,&rdquo; returned the Widow Van Flange.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I must pay them to keep him from prison. Once, when I refused, they were
      about to arrest him for giving a spurious check. My own attorney warned me
      they might do this. My son, himself, takes advantage of it. I would sooner
      be stripped of the last shilling, than suffer the name of Van Flange to be
      disgraced. Practicing upon my fears, he does not scruple to play into the
      hands of those who scheme his downfall. You may know what he is about,
      when I tell you that within the quarter I have been forced in this fashion
      to pay over twenty-seven thousand dollars. I see no way for it but to be
      ruined,&rdquo; and her lips twitched with the despair she felt.
    </p>
    <p>
      While the Widow Van Flange and I talked of her son and his down-hill
      courses, I will not pretend that I pondered any interference. The gamblers
      were a power in politics. The business of saving sons was none of mine;
      but, as I've said, I was willing, by hearing her story, to compliment the
      Reverend Bronson, who had suggested her visit. In the end, I would shift
      the burden to the police; they might be relied upon to find their way
      through the tangle to the advantage of themselves and the machine.
    </p>
    <p>
      Indeed, this same Gothecore would easily dispose of the affair. Expert
      with practice, there was none who could so run with the hare while
      pretending to course with the hounds. Softly, sympathetically, he would
      talk with the Widow Van Flange; and she would depart in the belief that
      her cause had found a friend.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the Widow Van Flange and I conversed, we were brought to sudden silence
      by a strange cry. It was a mad, screeching cry, such as might have come
      from some tigerish beast in a heat of fury. I was upon my feet in a
      moment, and flung open the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gothecore was standing outside, having come to my message. Over from him
      by ten feet was Melting Moses, his shoulders narrowed in a feline way,
      crouching, with brows drawn down and features in a snarl of hate. He was
      slowly backing away from Gothecore; not in fear, but rather like some
      cat-creature, measuring for a spring.
    </p>
    <p>
      On his side, Gothecore's face offered an equally forbidding picture. He
      was red with rage, and his bulldog jaws had closed like a trap.
      Altogether, I never beheld a more inveterate expression, like malice gone
      to seed.
    </p>
    <p>
      I seized Melting Moses by the shoulder, and so held him back from flying
      at Gothecore with teeth and claws.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He killed me mudder!&rdquo; cried Melting Moses, struggling in my fingers like
      something wild.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the janitor with whom Melting Moses lived had carried him off&mdash;and
      at that, the boy must be dragged away by force&mdash;I turned to
      Gothecore.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What was the trouble?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why do you stand for that young whelp?&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;I won't have it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The boy is doing you no harm.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I won't have it!&rdquo; he cried again. The man was like a maniac.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let me tell you one thing,&rdquo; I retorted, looking him between the eyes;
      &ldquo;unless you walk with care and talk with care, you are no better than a
      lost man. One word, one look, and I'll snuff you out between my thumb and
      finger as I might a candle.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There must have been that which showed formidable in my manner, for
      Gothecore stood as though stunned. The vicious insolence of the scoundrel
      had exploded the powder in my temper like a coal of fire. I pointed the
      way to my room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go in; I've business with you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Gothecore seemed to recall himself to steadiness. Without more words, he
      entered my door.
    </p>
    <p>
      With as much dignity as I might summon in the track of such a storm, I
      presented him to the Widow Van Flange. She had heard the sound of our
      differences; but, taken with her own troubles, she made no account of
      them. The Widow Van Flange received the rather boorish salutation of
      Gothecore in a way politely finished. Upon my hint, she gave him her
      story. Gothecore assumed a look at once professional and deprecatory.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An' now you're done, Madam,&rdquo; said Gothecore, giving that slight police
      cough by which he intimated for himself a limitless wisdom, &ldquo;an' now
      you're done, Madam, let me chip in a word. I know your son; I've knowed
      Billy Van Flange, now, goin' on three year&mdash;ever since he comes out
      o' college. I don't want to discourage you, Madam; but, to put it to you
      on th' square, Billy Van Flange is a warm member. I leave it to you to say
      if I aint right. Yes, indeed! he's as hot a proposition as ever went down
      th' line.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Here the eye of Gothecore wandered towards the ceiling, recalling the mad
      pranks of young Van Flange.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But these gamblers are destroying him!&rdquo; moaned the Widow Van Flange. &ldquo;Is
      there no way to shield him? Surely, you should know how to punish them,
      and keep him out of their hands!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know that gang of card sharps in Barclay Street,&rdquo; remarked Gothecore;
      &ldquo;an' they're a bunch of butes at that! But let me go on: I'll tell you
      what we can do; and then I'll tell you why it won't be fly to do it. In
      th' finish, however, it will all be up to you, Madam. We'll act on any
      steer you hand us. If you say 'pinch,' pinch goes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But as I was tellin': I'm dead onto Billy Van Flange; I know him like a
      gambler knows an ace. He hits up th' bottle pretty stiff at that, an' any
      man who finds him sober has got to turn out hours earlier than I do. An'
      I'll tell you another thing, Madam: This Billy Van Flange is a tough mug
      to handle. More'n once, I've tried to point him for home, an' every time
      it was a case of nothin' doin'. Sometimes he shed tears, an' sometimes he
      wanted to scrap; sometimes he'd give me th' laugh, an' sometimes he'd
      throw a front an' talk about havin' me fired off th' force. He'd run all
      the way from th' sob or th' fiery eye, to th' gay face or th' swell front,
      accordin' as he was jagged.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      While Gothecore thus descanted, the Widow Van Flange buried her face in
      her handkerchief. She heard his every word, however, and when Gothecore
      again consulted the ceiling, she signed for him to go on.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Knowin' New York as I do,&rdquo; continued Gothecore, &ldquo;I may tell you, Madam,
      that every time I get my lamps on that son of yours, I hold up my mits in
      wonder to think he aint been killed.&rdquo; The Widow Van Flange started; her
      anxious face was lifted from the handkerchief. &ldquo;That's on th' level! I've
      expected to hear of him bein' croaked, any time this twelve months. Th'
      best I looked for was that th' trick wouldn't come off in my precinct. He
      carries a wad in his pocket; an' he sports a streak of gilt, with a
      thousand-dollar rock, on one of his hooks; an' I could put you next to a
      hundred blokes, not half a mile from here, who'd do him up for half th'
      price. That's straight! Billy Van Flange, considerin' th' indoocements he
      hangs out, an' th' way he lays himself wide open to th' play, is lucky to
      be alive.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now why is he alive, Madam? It is due to them very gamblin' ducks in
      Barclay Street. Not that they love him; but once them skin gamblers gets a
      sucker on th' string, they protect him same as a farmer does his sheep.
      They look on him as money in th' bank; an' so they naturally see to it
      that no one puts his light out.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's how it stands, Madam!&rdquo; And now Gothecore made ready to bring his
      observations to a close. This Billy Van Flange, like every other rounder,
      has his hangouts. His is this deadfall on Barclay Street, with that
      hash-house keeper to give him th' dough for his checks. Now I'll tell you
      what I think. While he sticks to th' Barclay Street mob, he's safe. You'll
      get him back each time. They'll take his stuff; but they'll leave him his
      life, an' that's more than many would do.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Say th' word, however, an' I can put th' damper on. I can fix it so Billy
      Van Flange can't gamble nor cash checks in Barclay Street. They'll throw
      him out th' minute he sticks his nut inside the door. But I'll put you
      wise to it, Madam: If I do, inside of ninety days you'll fish him out o'
      th' river; you will, as sure as I'm a foot high!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The face of the Widow Van Flange was pale as paper now, and her bosom rose
      and fell with new terrors for her son. The words of Gothecore seemed
      prophetic of the passing of the last Van Flange.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Madam,&rdquo; said Gothecore, following a pause, &ldquo;I've put it up to you. Give
      me your orders. Say th' word, an' I'll have th' screws on that Barclay
      Street joint as fast as I can get back to my station-house.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But if we keep him from going there,&rdquo; said the Widow Van Flange, with a
      sort of hectic eagerness, &ldquo;he'll find another place, won't he?&rdquo; There was
      a curious look in the eyes of the Widow Van Flange. Her hand was pressed
      upon her bosom as if to smother a pang; her handkerchief went constantly
      to her lips. &ldquo;He would seek worse resorts?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's a cinch, Madam!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And he'd be murdered?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Madam, it's apples to ashes!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The eyes of the Widow Van Flange seemed to light up with an unearthly
      sparkle, while a flush crept out in her cheek. I was gazing upon these
      signs with wonder regarding them as things sinister, threatening ill.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly, she stood on her feet; and then she tottered in a blind, stifled
      way toward the window as though feeling for light and air. The next
      moment, the red blood came trickling from her mouth; she fell forward and
      I caught her in my arms.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's a hemorrhage!&rdquo; said Gothecore.
    </p>
    <p>
      The awe of death lay upon the man, and his coarse voice was stricken to a
      whisper.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now Heaven have my soul!&rdquo; murmured the dying woman. Then: &ldquo;My son! oh, my
      son!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There came another crimson cataract, and the Widow Van Flange was dead.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is your work!&rdquo; said I, turning fiercely to Gothecore.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Or is it yours?&rdquo; cries he.
    </p>
    <p>
      The words went over my soul like the teeth of a harrow. Was it my work?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, Chief!&rdquo; continued Gothecore, more calmly, and as though in answer to
      both himself and me, &ldquo;it's the work of neither of us. You think that what
      I said killed her. That may be as it may. Every word, however, was true. I
      but handed her th' straight goods.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Widow Van Flange was dead; and the thought of her son was in her heart
      and on her lips as her soul passed. And the son, bleared and drunken,
      gambled on in the Barclay Street den, untouched. The counters did not
      shake in his hand, nor did the blood run chill in his veins, as he
      continued to stake her fortune and his own in sottish ignorance.
    </p>
    <p>
      One morning, when the first snow of winter was beating in gusty swirls
      against the panes, Morton walked in upon me. I had not seen that
      middle-aged fop since the day when I laid out my social hopes and fears
      for Blossom. It being broad September at the time, Morton had pointed out
      how nothing might be done before the snows.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For our society people,&rdquo; observed Morton, on that September occasion,
      &ldquo;are migratory, like the wild geese they so much resemble. At this time
      they are leaving Newport for the country, don't y' know. They will not be
      found in town until the frost.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Now, when the snow and Morton appeared together, I recalled our
      conversation. I at once concluded that his visit had somewhat to do with
      our drawing-room designs. Nor was I in the wrong.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But first,&rdquo; said he, when in response to my question he had confessed as
      much, &ldquo;let us decide another matter. Business before pleasure; the getting
      of money should have precedence over its dissipation; it should, really! I
      am about to build a conduit, don't y' know, the whole length of Mulberry,
      and I desire you to ask your street department to take no invidious notice
      of the enterprise. You might tell your fellows that it wouldn't be good
      form.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But your franchise does not call for a conduit.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We will put it on the ground that Mulberry intends a change to the
      underground trolley&mdash;really! That will give us the argument; and I
      think, if needs press, your Corporation Counsel can read the law that way.
      He seems such a clever beggar, don't y' know!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But what do you want the conduit for?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There's nothing definite or sure as yet. My notion, however, is to
      inaugurate an electric-light company. The conduit, too, would do for
      telephone or telegraph, wires. Really, it's a good thing to have; and my
      men, when this beastly weather softens a bit, might as well be about the
      digging. All that's wanted of you, old chap, is to issue your orders to
      the department people to stand aloof, and offer no interruptions. It will
      be a great asset in the hands of Mulberry, that conduit; I shall increase
      the capital stock by five millions, on the strength of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your charter isn't in the way?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The charter contemplates the right on the part of Mulberry to change its
      power, don't y' know. We shall declare in favor of shifting to the
      underground trolley; although, really, we won't say when. The necessity of
      a conduit follows. Any chap can see that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well!&rdquo; I replied, &ldquo;there shall be no interference the city. If the
      papers grumble, I leave you and them to fight it out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now that's settled,&rdquo; said Morton, producing his infallible cigarette,
      &ldquo;let us turn to those social victories we have in contemplation. I take it
      you remain firm in your frantic resolutions?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do it for the good of my child,&rdquo; said I.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As though society, as presently practiced,&rdquo; cried Morton, &ldquo;could be for
      anybody's good! However, I was sure you would not change. You know the De
      Mudds? One of our best families, the De Mudds&mdash;really! They are on
      the brink of a tremendous function. They'll dine, and they'll dance, and
      all that sort of thing. They've sent you cards, the De Mudds have; and you
      and your daughter are to come. It's the thing to do; you can conquer
      society in the gross at the De Mudds.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm deeply obliged,&rdquo; said I. &ldquo;My daughter's peculiar nervous condition
      has preyed upon me more than I've admitted. The physician tells me that
      her best hope of health lies in the drawing-rooms.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let us trust so!&rdquo; said Morton. &ldquo;But, realty, old chap, you ought to be
      deucedly proud of the distinction which the De Mudds confer upon you.
      Americans are quite out of their line, don't y' know! And who can blame
      them? Americans are such common beggars; there's so many of them, they're
      vulgar. Mamma DeMudd's daughters&mdash;three of them&mdash;all married
      earls. Mamma DeMudd made the deal herself; and taking them by the lot, she
      had those noblemen at a bargain; she did, really! Five millions was the
      figure. Just think of it! five millions for three earls! Why, it was like
      finding them in the street!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'But what is he?' asked Mamma DeMudd, when I proposed you for her notice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'He's a despot,' said I, 'and rules New York. Every man in town is his
      serf.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When Mamma DeMudd got this magnificent idea into her head, she was eager
      to see you; she was, really.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;However,&rdquo; concluded Morton, &ldquo;let us change the subject, if only to
      restore my wits. The moment I speak of society, I become quite idiotic,
      don't y' know!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Speaking of new topics, then,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;let me ask of your father. How
      does he fare these days?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Busy, exceeding busy!&rdquo; returned Morton. &ldquo;He's buying a home in New
      Jersey. Oh, no, he won't live there; but he requires it as a basis for
      declaring that he's changed his residence, don't y' know! You'd wonder,
      gad! to see how frugal the old gentleman has grown in his old age. It's
      the personal property tax that bothers him; two per cent, on twenty
      millions come to quite a sum; it does, really! The old gentleman doesn't
      like it; so he's going to change his residence to New Jersey. To be sure,
      while he'll reside in New Jersey, he'll live here.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'It's a fribble, father,' said I, when he set forth his little game. 'Why
      don't you go down to the tax office, and commit perjury like a man? All
      your friends do.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, really! he couldn't; and he said so. The old gentleman lacks in
      those rugged characteristics, required when one swears to a point-blank
      lie.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When Morton was gone, I gave myself to pleasant dreams concerning Blossom.
      I was sure that the near company and conversation of those men and women
      of the better world, whom she was so soon to find about her, would
      accomplish all for which I prayed. Her nerves would be cooled; she would
      be drawn from out that hypochondria into which, throughout her life, she
      had been sinking as in a quicksand.
    </p>
    <p>
      I had not unfolded either my anxieties or my designs to Blossom. Now I
      would have Anne tell her of my plans. Time would be called for wherein to
      prepare the necessary wardrobe. She should have the best artistes; none
      must outshine my girl, of that I was resolved. These dress-labors, with
      their selections and fittings, would of themselves be excellent. They
      would employ her fancy, and save her from foolish fears of the De Mudds
      and an experience which she might think on as an ordeal. I never once
      considered myself&mdash;I, who was as ignorant of drawing-rooms as a
      cart-horse! Blossom held my thoughts. My heart would be implacable until
      it beheld her, placed and sure of herself, in the pleasant midst of those
      most elevated circles, towards which not alone my faith, but my admiration
      turned its eyes. I should be proud of her station, as well as relieved on
      the score of her health, when Blossom, serene and even and contained, and
      mistress of her own house, mingled on equal terms with ones who had credit
      as the nobility of the land.
    </p>
    <p>
      Was this the dream of a peasant grown rich? Was it the doting vision of a
      father mad with fondness? Why should I not so spread the nets of my money
      and my power as to ensnare eminence and the world's respect for this
      darling Blossom of mine? Wherein would lie the wild extravagance of the
      conceit? Surely, there were men in every sort my inferiors, and women, not
      one of whom was fit to play the rôle of maid to Blossom, who had rapped at
      this gate, and saw it open unto them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Home I went elate, high, walking on air. Nor did I consider how weak it
      showed, that I, the stern captain of thousands, and with a great city in
      my hands to play or labor with, should be thus feather-tickled with a toy!
      It was amazing, yes; and yet it was no less sweet:&mdash;this building of
      air-castles to house my Blossom in!
    </p>
    <p>
      It stood well beyond the strike of midnight as I told Anne the word that
      Morton had brought. Anne raised her dove's eyes to mine when I was done,
      and they were wet with tears. Anne's face was as the face of a nun, in its
      self-sacrifice and the tender, steady disinterest that looked from it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, as I exulted in a new bright life to be unrolled to the little tread
      of Blossom, I saw the shadows of a sorrow, vast and hopeless, settle upon
      Anne. At this I halted. As though to answer my silence, she put her hand
      caressingly upon my shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Brother,&rdquo; said Anne, &ldquo;you must set aside these thoughts for Blossom of
      men and women she will never meet, of ballrooms she will never enter, of
      brilliant costumes she will never wear. It is one and all impossible; you
      do not understand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With that, irritated of too much opposition and the hateful mystery of it,
      I turned roughly practical.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well!&rdquo; said I, in a hardest tone, &ldquo;admitting that I do not understand;
      and that I think on men and women she will never meet, and ballrooms she
      will never enter. Still, the costumes at least I can control, and it will
      mightily please me if you and Blossom at once attend to the frocks.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You do not understand!&rdquo; persisted Anne, with sober gentleness. &ldquo;Blossom
      would not wear an evening dress.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Anne, you grow daft!&rdquo; I cried. &ldquo;How should there be aught immodest in
      dressing like every best woman in town? The question of modesty is a
      question of custom; it is in the exception one will find the indelicate. I
      know of no one more immodest than a prude.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Blossom is asleep,&rdquo; said Anne, in her patient way. Then taking a
      bed-candle that burned on a table, she beckoned me. &ldquo;Come; I will show you
      what I mean. Make no noise; we must not wake Blossom. She must never know
      that you have seen. She has held this a secret from you; and I, for her
      poor sake, have done the same.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Anne opened the door of Blossom's room. My girl was in a gentle slumber.
      With touch light as down, Anne drew aside the covers from about her neck.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There,&rdquo; whispered Anne, &ldquo;there! Look on her throat!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Once, long before, a man had hanged himself, and I was called. I had never
      forgotten the look of those marks which belted the neck of that
      self-strangled man. Encircling the lily throat of Blossom, I saw the
      fellows to those marks&mdash;raw and red and livid!
    </p>
    <p>
      There are no words to tell the horror that swallowed me up. I turned ill;
      my reason stumbled on its feet. Anne led me from the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The mark of the rope!&rdquo; I gasped. &ldquo;It is the mark of the rope!&rdquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXI&mdash;THE REVEREND BRONSON'S REBELLION
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">W</span>HAT should it be?&mdash;this
      gallows-brand to show like a bruised ribbon of evil about the throat of
      Blossom! Anne gave me the story of it. It was a birthmark; that hangman
      fear which smote upon the mother when, for the death of Jimmy the
      Blacksmith, I was thrown into a murderer's cell, had left its hideous
      trace upon the child. In Blossom's infancy and in her earliest childhood,
      the mark had lain hidden beneath the skin as seeds lie buried and dormant
      in the ground. Slowly, yet no less surely, the inveterate years had
      quickened it and brought it to the surface; it had grown and never stopped&mdash;this
      mark! and with each year it took on added sullenness. The best word that
      Anne could give me was that it would so continue in its ugly
      multiplication until the day of Blossom's death. There could be no escape;
      no curing change, by any argument of medicine or surgery, was to be
      brought about; there it glared and there it would remain, a mark to shrink
      from! to the horrid last. And by that token, my plans of a drawing room
      for Blossom found annihilation. Anne had said the truth; those dreams that
      my girl should shine, starlike, in the firmament of high society, must be
      put away.
    </p>
    <p>
      It will have a trivial sound, and perchance be scoffed at, when I say that
      for myself, personally, I remember no blacker disappointment than that
      which overtook me as I realized how there could come none of those
      triumphs of chandeliers and floors of wax. Now as I examine myself, I can
      tell that not a little of this was due to my own vanity, and a secret wish
      I cherished to see my child the equal of the first.
    </p>
    <p>
      And if it were so, why should I be shamed? Might I not claim integrity for
      a pride which would have found its account in such advancement? I had been
      a ragged boy about the streets. I had grown up ignorant; I had climbed, if
      climbing be the word, unaided of any pedigree or any pocketbook, into a
      place of riches and autocratic sway. Wherefore, to have surrounded my
      daughter with the children of ones who had owned those advantages which I
      missed&mdash;folk of the purple, all!&mdash;and they to accept her, would
      have been a victory, and to do me honor. I shall not ask the pardon of men
      because I longed for it; nor do I scruple to confess the blow my hopes
      received when I learned how those ambitions would never find a crown.
    </p>
    <p>
      Following my sight of that gallows mark, I sat for a long time collecting
      myself. It was a dreadful thing to think upon; the more, since it seemed
      to me that Blossom suffered in my stead. It was as if that halter, which I
      defeated, had taken my child for a revenge.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What can we do?&rdquo; said I, at last.
    </p>
    <p>
      I spoke more from an instinct of conversation, and because I would have
      the company of Anne's sympathy, than with the thought of being answered to
      any purpose. I was set aback, therefore, by her reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let Blossom take the veil,&rdquo; said Anne. &ldquo;A convent, and the good work of
      it, would give her peace.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At that, I started resentfully. To one of my activity, I, who needed the
      world about me every moment&mdash;struggling, contending, succeeding&mdash;there
      could have come no word more hateful. The cell of a nun! It was as though
      Anne advised a refuge in the grave. I said as much, and with no special
      choice of phrases.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because Heaven in its injustice,&rdquo; I cried, &ldquo;has destroyed half her life,
      she is to make it a meek gift of the balance? Never, while I live! Blossom
      shall stay by me; I will make her happy in the teeth of Heaven!&rdquo; Thus did
      I hurl my impious challenge. What was to be the return, and the tempest it
      drew upon poor Blossom, I shall unfold before I am done. I have a worm of
      conscience whose slow mouth gnaws my nature, and you may name it
      superstition if you choose. And by that I know, when now I sit here,
      lonesome save for my gold, and with no converse better than the yellow
      mocking leer of it, that it was this, my blasphemy, which wrought in
      Heaven's retort the whole of that misery which descended to dog my girl
      and drag her down. How else shall I explain that double darkness which
      swallowed up her innocence? It was the bolt of punishment, which those
      skies I had outraged, aimed at me.
    </p>
    <p>
      Back to my labors of politics I went, with a fiercer heat than ever. My
      life, begun in politics, must end in politics. Still, there was a mighty
      change. I was not to look upon that strangling mark and escape the scar of
      it. I settled to a savage melancholy; I saw no pleasant moment. Constantly
      I ran before the hound-pack of my own thoughts, a fugitive, flying from
      myself.
    </p>
    <p>
      Also, there came the signs visible, and my hair was to turn and lose its
      color, until within a year it went as white as milk. Men, in the idleness
      of their curiosity, would notice this, and ask the cause. They were not to
      know; nor did Blossom ever learn how, led by Anne, I had crept upon her
      secret. It was a sorrow without a door, that sorrow of the hangman's mark;
      and because we may not remedy it, we will leave it, never again to be
      referred to until it raps for notice of its own black will.
    </p>
    <p>
      The death of the Widow Van Flange did not remove from before me the
      question of young Van Flange and his degenerate destinies. The Reverend
      Bronson took up the business where it fell from the nerveless fingers of
      his mother on that day she died.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not that I believe he can be saved,&rdquo; observed the Reverend Bronson; &ldquo;for
      if I am to judge, the boy is already lost beyond recall. But there is such
      goods as a pious vengeance&mdash;an anger of righteousness!&mdash;and I
      find it in my heart to destroy with the law, those rogues who against the
      law destroy others. That Barclay Street nest of adders must be burned out;
      and I come to you for the fire.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In a sober, set-faced way, I was amused by the dominie's extravagance. And
      yet I felt a call to be on my guard with him. Suppose he were to dislodge
      a stone which in its rolling should crash into and crush the plans of the
      machine! The town had been lost before, and oftener than once, as the
      result of beginnings no more grave. Aside from my liking for the good man,
      I was warned by the perils of my place to speak him softly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said I, trying for a humorous complexion, &ldquo;if you are bound for a
      wrestle with those blacklegs, I will see that you have fair play.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If that be true,&rdquo; returned the Reverend Bronson, promptly, &ldquo;give me
      Inspector McCue.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And why Inspector McCue?&rdquo; I asked. The suggestion had its baffling side.
      Inspector McCue was that honest one urged long ago upon Big Kennedy by
      Father Considine. I did not know Inspector McCue; there might lurk danger
      in the man. &ldquo;Why McCue?&rdquo; I repeated. &ldquo;The business of arresting gamblers
      belongs more with the uniformed police. Gothecore is your proper officer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gothecore is not an honest man,&rdquo; said the Reverend Bronson, with
      sententious frankness. &ldquo;McCue, on the other hand, is an oasis in the
      Sahara of the police. He can be trusted. If you support him he will
      collect the facts and enforce the law.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;you shall take McCue. I have no official control in
      the matter, being but a private man like yourself. But I will speak to the
      Chief of Police, and doubtless he will grant my request.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is, at least, reason to think so,&rdquo; retorted the Reverend Bronson in
      a dry tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before I went about an order to send Inspector McCue to the Reverend
      Bronson, I resolved to ask a question concerning him. Gothecore should be
      a well-head of information on that point; I would send for Gothecore. Also
      it might be wise to let him hear what was afoot for his precinct. He would
      need to be upon his defense, and to put others interested upon theirs.
    </p>
    <p>
      Melting Moses, who still stood warder at my portals, I dispatched upon
      some errand. The sight of Gothecore would set him mad. I felt sorrow
      rather than affection for Melting Moses. There was something unsettled and
      mentally askew with the boy. He was queer of feature, with the twisted
      fantastic face one sees carved on the far end of a fiddle. Commonly, he
      was light of heart, and his laugh would have been comic had it not been
      for a note of the weird which rang in it. I had not asked him, on the day
      when he went backing for a spring at the throat of Gothecore, the reason
      of his hate. His exclamation, &ldquo;He killed me mudder!&rdquo; told the story.
      Besides, I could have done no good. Melting Moses would have given me no
      reply. The boy, true to his faith of Cherry Hill, would fight out his
      feuds for himself; he would accept no one's help, and regarded the term
      &ldquo;squealer&rdquo; as an epithet of measureless disgrace.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Gothecore came in, I caught him at the first of it glowering
      furtively about, as though seeking someone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where is that Melting Moses?&rdquo; he inquired, when he saw how I observed him
      to be searching the place with his eye.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And why?&rdquo; said I.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought I'd look him over, if you didn't mind. I can't move about my
      precinct of nights but he's behind me, playin' th' shadow. I want to know
      why he pipes me off, an' who sets him to it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well then,&rdquo; said I, a bit impatiently, &ldquo;I should have thought a
      full-grown Captain of Police was above fearing a boy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Without giving Gothecore further opening, I told him the story of the
      Reverend Bronson, and that campaign of purity he would be about.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And as to young Van Flange,&rdquo; said I. &ldquo;Does he still lose his money in
      Barclay Street?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They've cleaned him up,&rdquo; returned Gothecore. &ldquo;Billy Van Flange is gone,
      hook, line, and sinker. He's on his uppers, goin' about panhandlin' old
      chums for a five-dollar bill.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They made quick work of him,&rdquo; was my comment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He would have it,&rdquo; said Gothecore. &ldquo;When his mother died th' boy got his
      bridle off. Th' property&mdash;about two hundred thousand dollars&mdash;was
      in paper an' th' way he turned it into money didn't bother him a bit. He
      came into Barclay Street, simply padded with th' long green&mdash;one-thousand-dollar
      bills, an' all that&mdash;an' them gams took it off him so fast he caught
      cold. He's dead broke; th' only difference between him an' a hobo, right
      now, is a trunk full of clothes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Reverend Bronson,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;has asked for Inspector McCue. What sort
      of a man is McCue?&rdquo; Gothecore wrinkled his face into an expression of
      profound disgust.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who's McCue?&rdquo; he repeated. &ldquo;He's one of them mugwump pets. He makes a
      bluff about bein' honest, too, does McCue. I think he'd join a church, if
      he took a notion it would stiffen his pull.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But is he a man of strength? Can he make trouble?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Trouble?&rdquo; This with contempt. &ldquo;When it comes to makin' trouble, he's a
      false alarm.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said I, in conclusion, &ldquo;McCue and the dominie are going into your
      precinct.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll tell you one thing,&rdquo; returned Gothecore, his face clouding up, &ldquo;I
      think it's that same Reverend Bronson who gives Melting Moses th' office
      to dog me. I'll put Mr. Whitechoker onto my opinion of th' racket, one of
      these days.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You'd better keep your muzzle on,&rdquo; I retorted. &ldquo;Your mouth will get you
      into trouble yet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Gothecore went away grumbling, and much disposed to call himself ill-used.
    </p>
    <p>
      During the next few days I was to receive frequent visits from the
      Reverend Bronson. His mission was to enlist me in his crusade against the
      gamblers. I put him aside on that point.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You should remember,&rdquo; said I, as pleasantly as I well could, &ldquo;that I am a
      politician, not a policeman. I shall think of my party, and engage in no
      unusual moral exploits of the sort you suggest. The town doesn't want it
      done.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The question,&rdquo; responded the Reverend Bronson warmly, &ldquo;is one of law and
      morality, and not of the town's desires. You say you are a politician, and
      not a policeman. If it comes to that, I am a preacher, and not a
      policeman. Still, I no less esteem it my duty to interfere for right. I
      see no difference between your position and my own.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I do. To raid gamblers, and to denounce them, make for your success
      in your profession. With me, it would be all the other way. It is quite
      easy for you to adopt the path you do. Now I am not so fortunately
      placed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are the head of Tammany Hall,&rdquo; said the Reverend Bronson solemnly.
      &ldquo;It is a position which loads you with responsibility, since your power
      for good or bad in the town is absolute. You have but to point your finger
      at those gambling dens, and they would wither from the earth.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now you do me too much compliment,&rdquo; said I. &ldquo;The Chief of Tammany is a
      much weaker man than you think. Moreover, I shall not regard myself as
      responsible for the morals of the town.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Take young Van Flange,&rdquo; went on the Reverend Bronson, disregarding my
      remark. &ldquo;They've ruined the boy; and you might have saved him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And there you are mistaken,&rdquo; I replied. &ldquo;But if it were so, why should I
      be held for his ruin? 'I am not my brother's keeper.'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And so Cain said,&rdquo; responded the Reverend Bronson. Then, as he was
      departing: &ldquo;I do not blame you too much, for I can see that you are the
      slave of your position. But do not shield yourself with the word that you
      are not your brother's keeper. You may be made grievously to feel that
      your brother's welfare is your welfare, and that in his destruction your
      own destruction is also to be found.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Men have rallied me as superstitious, and it may be that some grains of
      truth lie buried in that charge. Sure it is, that this last from the
      Reverend Bronson was not without its uncomfortable effect. It pressed upon
      me in a manner vaguely dark, and when he was gone, I caught myself
      regretting the &ldquo;cleaning up,&rdquo; as Gothecore expressed it, of the dissolute
      young Van Flange.
    </p>
    <p>
      And yet, why should one feel sympathy for him who, by his resolute
      viciousness, struck down his own mother? If ever rascal deserved ruin, it
      was he who had destroyed the hopes of one who loved him before all! The
      more I considered, the less tender for the young Van Flange I grew. And as
      to his destruction carrying personal scathe for me, it might indeed do, as
      a flourish of the pulpit, to say so, but it was a thought too far fetched,
      as either a warning or a prophecy, to justify one in transacting by its
      light his own existence, or the affairs of a great organization of
      politics. The end of it was that I smiled over a weakness that permitted
      me to be disturbed by mournful forebodes, born of those accusing
      preachments of the Reverend Bronson.
    </p>
    <p>
      For all that my reverend mentor was right; the sequel proved how those
      flames which licked up young Van Flange were to set consuming fire to my
      own last hope.
    </p>
    <p>
      It would seem that young Van Flange, as a topic, was in everybody's mouth.
      Morton, having traction occasion for calling on me, began to talk of him
      at once.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Really!&rdquo; observed Morton, discussing young Van Flange, &ldquo;while he's a
      deuced bad lot, don't y' know, and not at all likely to do Mulberry
      credit, I couldn't see him starve, if only for his family. So I set him to
      work, as far from the company's money as I could put him, and on the
      soberish stipend of nine hundred dollars a year. I look for the best
      effects from those nine hundred dollars; a chap can't live a double life
      on that; he can't, really!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you call him a bad lot,&rdquo; said I.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The worst in the world,&rdquo; returned Morton. &ldquo;You see young Van Flange is
      such a weakling; really, there's nothing to tie to. All men are vicious;
      but there are some who are strong enough to save themselves. This fellow
      isn't.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;His family is one of the best,&rdquo; said I.
    </p>
    <p>
      For myself, I've a sincere respect for blood, and some glimpse of it must
      have found display in my face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear boy,&rdquo; cried Morton, &ldquo;there's no more empty claptrap than this
      claptrap of family.&rdquo; Here Morton adorned his high nose with the eyeglass
      that meant so much with him, and surveyed me as from a height. &ldquo;There's
      nothing in a breed when it comes to a man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Would you say the same of a horse or a dog?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By no means, old chap; but a dog or a horse is prodigiously a different
      thing, don't y' know. The dominant traits of either of those noble
      creatures are honesty, courage, loyalty&mdash;they're the home of the
      virtues. Now a man is another matter. He's an evil beggar, is a man; and,
      like a monkey, he has virtues only so far as you force him to adopt them.
      As Machiavelli says: 'We're born evil, and become good only by
      compulsion.' Now to improve a breed, as the phrase is, makes simply for
      the promotion of what are the dominant traits of the creature one has in
      hand. Thus, to refine or emphasize the horse and the dog, increases them
      in honesty, loyalty, and courage since such are top-traits with those
      animals. With a monkey or a man, and by similar argument, the more you
      refine him, the more abandoned he becomes. Really,&rdquo; and here Morton
      restored himself with a cigarette, &ldquo;I shouldn't want these views to find
      their way to my club. It would cause the greatest row ever in our set; it
      would, really! I am made quite ill to only think of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What would you call a gentleman, then?&rdquo; I asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      Morton's theories, while I in no manner subscribed to them, entertained
      me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What should I call a gentleman? Why I should call him the caricature of a
      man, don't y' know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Reverend Bronson had been abroad in his campaign against those
      sharpers of Barclay Street for perhaps four weeks. I understood, without
      paying much heed to the subject, that he was seeking the evidence of their
      crimes, with a final purpose of having them before a court. There had been
      no public stir; the papers had said nothing. What steps had been taken
      were taken without noise. I doubted not that the investigation would, in
      the finish, die out. The hunted ones of Barclay Street were folk well used
      to the rôle of fugitive, and since Gothecore kept them informed of the
      enemy's strategy, I could not think they would offer the Reverend Bronson
      and his ally, McCue, any too much margin.
    </p>
    <p>
      As yet, I had never seen this McCue. By that, I knew him to be an honest
      man. Not that one is to understand how none save a rogue would come to me.
      I need hardly explain, however, that every policeman of dark-lantern
      methods was eagerly prone to make my acquaintance. It was a merest
      instinct of caution; the storm might break and he require a friend. Now
      this McCue had never sought to know me, and so I argued that his record
      was pure white.
    </p>
    <p>
      This did not please me; I preferred men upon whom one might have some
      hold. These folk of a smooth honesty go through one's fingers like water,
      and no more of a grip to be obtained upon one of them than upon the
      Hudson. I made up my mind that I would see this McCue.
    </p>
    <p>
      Still I did not send for him; it was no part of my policy to exhibit
      concern in one with whom I was strange, and who later might open his mouth
      to quote it against me. McCue, however, was so much inclined to humor my
      desire, that one afternoon he walked into my presence of his own free
      will.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My name is McCue,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;Inspector McCue.&rdquo; I motioned him to a chair.
      &ldquo;I've been told to collect evidence against certain parties in Barclay
      Street,&rdquo; he added. Then he came to a full stop.
    </p>
    <p>
      While I waited for him to proceed in his own way and time, I studied
      Inspector McCue. He was a square-shouldered man, cautious, keen, resolute;
      and yet practical, and not one to throw himself away in the jaws of the
      impossible. What he had come to say, presently proved my estimate of him.
      On the whole, I didn't like the looks of Inspector McCue.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is your purpose?&rdquo; I asked at last. &ldquo;I need not tell you that I have
      no official interest in what you may be about. Still less have I a
      personal concern.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Inspector McCue's only retort was a grimace that did not add to his
      popularity. Next he went boldly to the object of his call.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What I want to say is this,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;I've collected the evidence I was
      sent after; I can lay my hands on the parties involved as keepers and
      dealers in that Barclay Street den. But I'm old enough to know that all
      the evidence in the world won't convict these crooks unless the machine is
      willing. I'm ready to go ahead and take my chances. But I'm not ready to
      run against a stone wall in the dark. I'd be crazy, where no good can
      come, to throw myself away.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now this is doubtless of interest to you,&rdquo; I replied, putting some
      impression of distance into my tones, &ldquo;but what have I to do with the
      matter?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Only this,&rdquo; returned McCue. &ldquo;I'd like to have you tell me flat, whether
      or no you want these parties pinched.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Inspector McCue,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;if that be your name and title, it sticks in
      my head that you are making a mistake. You ask me a question which you
      might better put to your chief.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We won't dispute about it,&rdquo; returned my caller; &ldquo;and I'm not here to give
      offense. I am willing to do my duty; but, as I've tried to explain, I
      don't care to sacrifice myself if the game's been settled against me in
      advance. You speak of my going to the chief. If arrests are to be made,
      he's the last man I ought to get my orders from.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you will be so good as to explain?&rdquo; said I.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because, if I am to go on, I must begin by collaring the chief. He's the
      principal owner of that Barclay Street joint.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This was indeed news, and I had no difficulty in looking grave.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Captain Gothecore is in it, too; but his end is with the restaurant
      keeper. That check-cashing racket was a case of flam; there was a hold-out
      went with that play. The boy, Van Flange, was always drunk, and the best
      he ever got for, say a five-hundred-dollar check, was three hundred
      dollars. Gothecore was in on the difference. There's the lay-out. Not a
      pleasant outlook, certainly; and not worth attempting arrests about unless
      I know that the machine is at my back.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You keep using the term 'machine,'&rdquo; said I coldly. &ldquo;If by that you mean
      Tammany Hall, I may tell you, sir, that the 'machine' has no concern in
      the affair. You will do your duty as you see it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Inspector McCue sat biting his lips. After a moment, he got upon his feet
      to go.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think it would have been better,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;if you had met me frankly.
      However, I've showed you my hand; now I'll tell you what my course will
      be. This is Wednesday. I must, as you've said yourself, do my duty. If&mdash;mark
      you, I say 'If'&mdash;if I am in charge of this case on Saturday, I shall
      make the arrests I've indicated.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you ever see such gall!&rdquo; exclaimed the Chief of Police, when I
      recounted my conversation with Inspector McCue. Then, holding up his pudgy
      hands in a manner of pathetic remonstrance: &ldquo;It shows what I told you long
      ago. One honest man will put th' whole force on th' bum!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Inspector McCue, on the day after his visit, was removed from his place,
      and ordered to a precinct in the drear far regions of the Bronx. The order
      was hardly dry on the paper when there descended upon me the Reverend
      Bronson, his eyes glittering with indignation, and a protest against this
      Siberia for Inspector McCue apparent in his face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And this,&rdquo; cried the Reverend Bronson, as he came through the door, &ldquo;and
      this is what comes to an officer who is willing to do his duty!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sit down, Doctor,&rdquo; said I soothingly, at the same time placing a chair;
      &ldquo;sit down.&rdquo;

      CHAPTER XXII&mdash;THE MAN OF THE KNIFE
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">W</span>HEN the first gust
      was over, the Reverend Bronson seemed sad rather than enraged. He
      reproached the machine for the failure of his effort against that gambling
      den.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But why do you call yourself defeated?&rdquo; I asked. It was no part of my
      purpose to concede, even by my silence, that either I or Tammany was
      opposed to the Reverend Bronson. &ldquo;You should put the matter to the test of
      a trial before you say that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What can I do without Inspector McCue? and he has been removed from the
      affair. I talked with him concerning it; he told me himself there was no
      hope.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, what were his words?&rdquo; said I, for I was willing to discover how far
      Inspector McCue had used my name.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, then,&rdquo; returned the Reverend Bronson, with a faint smile at the
      recollection, &ldquo;if I am to give you the precise words, our talk ran
      somewhat like this:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Doctor, what's the use?' said Inspector McCue. 'We're up against it; we
      can't move a wheel.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'There's such a word as law,' said I, advancing much, the argument you
      have just now given me; 'and such a thing as justice.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Not in the face of the machine,' responded Inspector McCue. 'The will of
      the machine stands for all the law and all the justice that we're likely
      to get. The machine has the courts, the juries, the prosecuting officers,
      and the police. Every force we need is in its hands. Personally, of
      course, they couldn't touch you; but if I were to so much as lift a
      finger, I'd be destroyed. Some day I, myself, may be chief; and if I am,
      for once in a way, I'll guarantee the decent people of this town a run for
      their money.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'And yet,' said I, 'we prate of liberty!'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Liberty!' cried he. 'Doctor, our liberties are in hock to the
      politicians, and we've lost the ticket.'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was in my mind to presently have the stripes and buttons off the
      loquacious, honest Inspector McCue. The Reverend Bronson must have caught
      some gleam of it in my eye; he remonstrated with a gentle hand upon my
      arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Promise me that no more harm shall come to McCue,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I ought not
      to have repeated his words. He has been banished to the Bronx; isn't that
      punishment enough for doing right?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; I returned, after a pause; &ldquo;I give you my word, your friend is in
      no further peril. You should tell him, however, to forget the name,
      'machine.' Also, he has too many opinions for a policeman.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The longer I considered, the more it was clear that it would not be a
      cautious policy to cashier McCue. It would make an uproar which I did not
      care to court when so near hand to an election. It was not difficult,
      therefore, to give the Reverend Bronson that promise, and I did it with a
      good grace.
    </p>
    <p>
      Encouraged by my compliance, the Reverend Bronson pushed into an argument,
      the object of which was to bring me to his side for the town's reform.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Doctor,&rdquo; said I, when he had set forth what he conceived to be my duty to
      the premises, &ldquo;even if I were disposed to go with you, I would have to go
      alone. I could no more take Tammany Hall in the direction you describe,
      than I could take the East River. As I told you once before, you should
      consider our positions. It is the old quarrel of theory and practice. You
      proceed upon a theory that men are what they should be; I must practice
      existence upon the fact of men as they are.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is a debt you owe Above!&rdquo; returned the Reverend Bronson, the
      preacher within him beginning to struggle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what debt should that be?&rdquo; I cried, for my mind, on the moment, ran
      gloomily to Blossom. &ldquo;What debt should I owe there?&mdash;I, who am the
      most unhappy man in the world!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There came a look into the eyes of the Reverend Bronson that was at once
      sharp with interrogation and soft with sympathy. He saw that I had been
      hard wounded, although he could not know by what; and he owned the kindly
      tact to change the course of his remarks.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is one point, sure,&rdquo; resumed the Reverend Bronson, going backward
      in his trend of thought, &ldquo;and of that I warn you. I shall not give up this
      fight. I began with an attack upon those robbers, and I've been withstood
      by ones who should have strengthened my hands. I shall now assail, not
      alone the lawbreakers, but their protectors. I shall attack the machine
      and the police. I shall take this story into every paper that will print
      it; I shall summon the pulpits to my aid; I shall arouse the people, if
      they be not deaf or dead, to wage war on those who protect such vultures
      in their rapine for a share of its returns. There shall be a moral
      awakening; and you may yet conclude, when you sit down in the midst of
      defeat, that honesty is after all the best policy, and that virtue has its
      reward.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Reverend Bronson, in the heat of feeling, had risen from the chair,
      and declaimed rather than said this, while striding up and down. To him it
      was as though my floor were a rostrum, and the private office of Tammany's
      Chief, a lecture room. I am afraid I smiled a bit cynically at his ardor
      and optimism, for he took me in sharp hand, &ldquo;Oh! I shall not lack
      recruits,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;and some will come from corners you might least
      suspect. I met your great orator, Mr. Gutterglory, but a moment ago; he
      gave me his hand, and promised his eloquence to the cause of reform.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nor does that surprise me,&rdquo; said I. Then, with a flush of wrath: &ldquo;You may
      say to orator Gutterglory that I shall have something to remind him of
      when he takes the stump in your support.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      My anger over Gutterglory owned a certain propriety of foundation. He was
      that sodden Cicero who marred the scene when, long before, I called on Big
      Kennedy, with the reputable old gentleman and Morton, to consult over the
      Gas Company's injunction antics touching Mulberry Traction. By some
      wonderful chance, Gutterglory had turned into sober walks. Big Kennedy,
      while he lived, and afterward I, myself, had upheld him, and put him in
      the way of money. He paid us with eloquence in conventions and campaigns,
      and on show occasions when Tammany would celebrate a holiday or a victory.
      From low he soared to high, and surely none was more pleased thereby than
      I. On every chance I thrust him forward; and I was sedulous to see that
      always a stream of dollar-profit went running his way.
    </p>
    <p>
      Morton, I remember, did not share my enthusiasm. It was when I suggested
      Gutterglory as counsel for Mulberry.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But really now!&rdquo; objected Morton, with just a taint of his old-time lisp,
      &ldquo;the creature doesn't know enough. He's as shallow as a skimming dish,
      don't y' know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gutterglory is the most eloquent of men,&rdquo; I protested.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I grant you the beggar is quite a talker, and all that,&rdquo; retorted Morton,
      twirling that potential eyeglass, &ldquo;but the trouble is, old chap, that when
      we've said that, we've said all. Gutterglory is a mere rhetorical freak.
      He ought to take a rest, and give his brain a chance to grow up with his
      vocabulary.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      What Morton said had no effect on me; I clung to Gutterglory, and made his
      life worth while. I was given my return when I learned that for years he
      had gone about, unknown to me, extorting money from people with the use of
      my name. Scores have paid peace-money to Gutterglory, and thought it was I
      who bled them. So much are we at the mercy of rascals who win our
      confidence!
    </p>
    <p>
      It was the fact of his learning that did it. I could never be called a
      good judge of one who knew books. I was over prone to think him of finest
      honor who wrote himself a man of letters, for it was my weakness to trust
      where I admired. In the end, I discovered the villain duplicity of
      Gutterglory, and cast him out; at that, the scoundrel was rich with six
      figures to his fortune, and every dime of it the harvest of some blackmail
      in my name.
    </p>
    <p>
      He became a great fop, did Gutterglory; and when last I saw him&mdash;it
      being Easter Day, as I stepped from the Cathedral, where I'd been with
      Blossom&mdash;he was teetering along Fifth Avenue, face powdered and a
      glow of rouge on each cheekbone, stayed in at the waist, top hat, frock
      coat, checked trousers, snowy &ldquo;spats&rdquo; over his patent leathers, a violet
      in his buttonhole, a cane carried endwise in his hand, elbows crooked,
      shoulders bowed, the body pitched forward on his toes, a perfect picture
      of that most pitiful of things&mdash;an age-seamed doddering old dandy!
      This was he whom the Reverend Bronson vaunted as an ally!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are welcome to Gutterglory,&rdquo; said I to my reverend visitor on that
      time when he named him as one to become eloquent for reform. &ldquo;It but
      proves the truth of what Big John Kennedy so often said: Any rogue, kicked
      out of Tammany Hall for his scoundrelisms, can always be sure of a job as
      a 'reformer.'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Really!&rdquo; observed Morton, when a few days later I was telling him of the
      visit of the Reverend Bronson, &ldquo;I've a vast respect for Bronson. I can't
      say that I understand him&mdash;working for nothing among the scum and
      rubbish of humanity!&mdash;for personally I've no talent for religion,
      don't y' know! And so he thinks that honesty is the best policy!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He seemed to think it not open to contradiction.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hallucination, positive hallucination, my boy! At-least, if taken in a
      money sense; and 'pon my word! that's the only sense in which it's worth
      one's while to take anything&mdash;really! Honesty the best policy! Why,
      our dominie should look about him. Some of our most profound scoundrels
      are our richest men. Money is so much like water, don't y' know, that it
      seems always to seek the lowest places;&rdquo; and with that, Morton went his
      elegant way, yawning behind his hand, as if to so much exert his
      intelligence wearied him.
    </p>
    <p>
      For over nine years&mdash;ever since the death of Big Kennedy&mdash;I had
      kept the town in my hands, and nothing strong enough to shake my hold upon
      it. This must have its end. It was not in the chapter of chance that
      anyone's rule should be uninterrupted. Men turn themselves in bed, if for
      no reason than just to lie the other way; and so will your town turn on
      its couch of politics. Folk grow weary of a course or a conviction, and to
      rest themselves, they will put it aside and have another in its place.
      Then, after a bit, they return to the old.
    </p>
    <p>
      In politics, these shifts, which are really made because the community
      would relax from some pose of policy and stretch itself in new directions,
      are ever given a pretense of morality as their excuse. There is a hysteria
      to arise from the crush and jostle of the great city. Men, in their
      crowded nervousness, will clamor for the new. This is also given the name
      of morals. And because I was aware how these conditions of restlessness
      and communal hysteria ever subsist, and like a magazine of powder ask but
      the match to fire them and explode into fragments whatever rule might at
      the time exist, I went sure that some day, somehow the machine would be
      overthrown. Also, I went equally certain how defeat would be only
      temporary, and that before all was done, the town would again come back to
      the machine.
    </p>
    <p>
      You've seen a squall rumple and wrinkle and toss the bosom of a lake? If
      you had investigated, you would have learned how that storm-disturbance
      was wholly of the surface. It did not bite the depths below. When the gust
      had passed, the lake&mdash;whether for good or bad&mdash;re-settled to its
      usual, equal state. Now the natural conditions of New York are machine
      conditions. Wherefore, I realized, as I've written, that no gust of
      reformation could either trouble it deeply or last for long, and that the
      moment it had passed, the machine must at once succeed to the situation.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, when the Reverend Bronson left me, vowing insurrection, I had no
      fears of the sort immediate. The times were not hysterical, nor ripe for
      change. I would re-carry the city; the Reverend Bronson&mdash;if his
      strength were to last that long&mdash;with those moralists he enlisted,
      might defeat me on some other distant day. But for the election at hand I
      was safe by every sign.
    </p>
    <p>
      As I pored over the possibilities, I could discern no present argument in
      his favor. He himself might be morally sure of machine protection for
      those men of Barclay Street. But to the public he could offer no practical
      proof. Should he tell the ruin of young Van Flange, no one would pay
      peculiar heed. Such tales were of the frequent. Nor would the fate of
      young Van Flange, who had employed his name and his fortune solely as the
      bed-plates of an endless dissipation, evoke a sympathy. Indeed those who
      knew him best&mdash;those who had seen him then, and who saw him now at
      his Mulberry Traction desk, industrious, sober, respectable in a
      hall-bedroom way on his narrow nine hundred a year, did not scruple to
      declare that his so-called ruin was his regeneration, and that those
      card-criminals who took his money had but worked marvels for his good. No;
      I could not smell defeat in the contest coming down. I was safe for the
      next election; and the eyes of no politician, let me tell you, are strong
      enough to see further than the ballot just ahead. On these facts and their
      deductions, while I would have preferred peace between the Reverend
      Bronson and the machine, and might have conceded not a little to preserve
      it, I based no present fears of that earnest gentleman, nor of any fires
      of politics he might kindle.
    </p>
    <p>
      And I would have come through as I forejudged, had it not been for that
      element of the unlooked-for to enter into the best arranged equation, and
      which this time fought against me. There came marching down upon me a
      sudden procession of blood in a sort of red lockstep of death. In it was
      carried away that boy of my door, Melting Moses, and I may say that his
      going clouded my eye. Gothecore went also; but I felt no sorrow for the
      death of that ignobility in blue, since it was the rock of his murderous,
      coarse brutality on which I split. There was a third to die, an innocent
      and a stranger; however, I might better give the story of it by beginning
      with a different strand.
    </p>
    <p>
      In that day when the Reverend Bronson and Inspector McCue worked for the
      condemnation of those bandits of Barclay Street, there was one whom they
      proposed as a witness when a case should be called in court. This man had
      been a waiter in the restaurant which robbed young Van Flange, and in
      whose pillage Gothecore himself was said to have had his share.
    </p>
    <p>
      After Inspector McCue was put away in the Bronx, and the Reverend Bronson
      made to give up his direct war upon the dens, this would-be witness was
      arrested and cast into a cell of the station where Gothecore held sway.
      The Reverend Bronson declared that the arrested one had been seized by
      order of Gothecore, and for revenge. Gothecore, ignorant, cruel,
      rapacious, violent, and with never a glimmer of innate fineness to teach
      him those external decencies which go between man and man as courtesy,
      gave by his conduct a deal of plausibility to the charge.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Get out of my station!&rdquo; cried Gothecore, with a rain of oath upon oath;
      &ldquo;get out, or I'll have you chucked out!&rdquo; This was when the Reverend
      Bronson demanded the charge on which the former waiter was held. &ldquo;Do a
      sneak!&rdquo; roared Gothecore, as the Reverend Bronson stood in silent
      indignation. &ldquo;I'll have no pulpit-thumper doggin' me! You show your mug in
      here ag'in, an' you'll get th' next cell to that hash-slingin' stoolpigeon
      of yours. You can bet your life, I aint called Clean Sweep Bill for fun!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As though this were not enough, there arrived in its wake another bit of
      news that made me, who was on the threshold of my campaign to retain the
      town, bite my lip and dig my palms with the anger it unloosed within me.
      By way of added fuel to flames already high, that one waiter, but the day
      before prisoner to Gothecore, must be picked up dead in the streets, head
      club-battered to a pulp.
    </p>
    <p>
      Who murdered the man?
    </p>
    <p>
      Half the town said Gothecore.
    </p>
    <p>
      For myself, I do not care to dwell upon that poor man's butchery, and my
      veins run fire to only think of it. There arises the less call for
      elaboration, since within hours&mdash;for it was the night of that very
      day on which the murdered man was found&mdash;the life was stricken from
      the heart of Gothecore. He, too, was gone; and Melting Moses had gone with
      him. By his own choice, this last, as I have cause to know.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll do him before I'm through!&rdquo; sobbed Melting Moses, as he was held
      back from Gothecore on the occasion when he would have gone foaming for
      his throat; &ldquo;I'll get him, if I have to go wit' him!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was the Chief of Police who brought me word. I had sent for him with a
      purpose of charges against Gothecore, preliminary to his dismissal from
      the force. Aside from my liking for the Reverend Bronson, and the
      resentment I felt for the outrage put upon him, Gothecore must go as a
      defensive move of politics.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Chief's eye, when he arrived, popped and stared with a fishy horror,
      and for all the coolness of the early morning his brow showed clammy and
      damp. I was in too hot a hurry to either notice or remark on these
      phenomena; I reeled off my commands before the visitor could find a chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You're too late, Gov'nor,&rdquo; returned the Chief, munching uneasily, his fat
      jowls working. &ldquo;For once in a way, you've gone to leeward of the
      lighthouse.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo; said I.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then he told the story; and how Gothecore and Melting Moses were taken
      from the river not four hours before.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was a fire in th' box factory,&rdquo; said the Chief; &ldquo;that factory 'buttin'
      on th' docks. Gothecore goes down from his station. The night's as dark as
      the inside of a cow. He's jimmin' along th' edge of th' wharf, an' no one
      noticin' in particular. Then of a sudden, there's an oath an' a big
      splash.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Man overboard!' yells some guy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The man overboard is Gothecore. Two or three coves come chasin' up to
      lend a hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Some duck jumps after him to save him,' says this party who yells
      'overboard!' 'First one, an' then t'other, hits th' water. They oughter be
      some'ers about.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That second party in th' river was Melting Moses. An' say! Gov'nor, he
      didn't go after Gothecore to save him; not he! Melting Moses had shoved
      Gothecore in; an' seein' him swimmin' hard, an' likely to get ashore, he
      goes after him to cinch th' play. I'll tell you one thing: he cinches it.
      He piles himself on Gothecore's back, an' then he crooks his right arm
      about Gothecore's neck&mdash;the reg'lar garotte hug! an' enough to choke
      th' life out by itself. That aint th' worst.&rdquo; Here the Chief's voice sunk
      to a whisper. &ldquo;Melting Moses had his teeth buried in Gothecore's throat.
      Did you ever unlock a bulldog from his hold? Well, it was easy money
      compared to unhookin' Melting Moses from Gothecore. Sure! both was dead as
      mackerels when they got 'em out; they're on th' ice right now. Oh, well!&rdquo;
       concluded the Chief; &ldquo;I told Gothecore his finish more'n once. 'Don't
      rough people around so, Bill,' I'd say; 'you'll dig up more snakes than
      you can kill.' But he wouldn't listen; he was all for th' strong-arm, an'
      th' knock-about! It's a bad system. Nothin's lost by bein' smooth,
      Gov'nor; nothin's lost by bein' smooth!&rdquo; and the Chief sighed
      lugubriously; after which he mopped his forehead and looked pensively from
      the window.
    </p>
    <p>
      Your river sailor, on the blackest night, will feel the tide for its ebb
      or flow by putting his hand in the water. In a manner of speaking, I could
      now as plainly feel the popular current setting against the machine. It
      was like a strong flood, and with my experience of the town and its
      tempers I knew that we were lost. That murdered man who might have been a
      witness, and the violence done to the Reverend Bronson, were arguments in
      everybody's mouth.
    </p>
    <p>
      And so the storm fell; the machine was swept away as by a flood. There was
      no sleight of the ballot that might have saved the day; our money proved
      no defense. The people fell upon Tammany and crushed it, and the town went
      from under my hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      Morton had seen disaster on its way.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And, really! I don't half like it,&rdquo; observed that lounging king of
      traction. &ldquo;It will cost me a round fifty thousand dollars, don't y' know!
      Of course, I shall give Tammany the usual fifty thousand, if only for the
      memory of old days. But, by Jove! there's those other chaps. Now they're
      going to win, in the language of our departed friend, Mr. Kennedy, I'll
      have to 'sweeten' them. It's a deuced bore contributing to both parties,
      but this time I can't avoid it&mdash;really!&rdquo; and Morton stared feebly
      into space, as though the situation held him helpless with its
      perplexities.
    </p>
    <p>
      There is one worth-while matter to be the offspring of defeat. A beaten
      man may tell the names of his friends. On the day after I scored a
      victory, my ante-rooms had been thronged. Following that disaster to the
      machine, just chronicled, I sat as much alone as though Fourteenth Street
      were the center of a pathless waste.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, I was not to be wholly deserted. It was in the first shadows of
      the evening, when a soiled bit of paper doing crumpled duty as a card was
      brought me. I glanced at it indifferently. I had nothing to give; why
      should anyone seek me? There was no name, but my interest flared up at
      this line of identification:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Man of the Knife!&rdquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXIII&mdash;THE WEDDING OF BLOSSOM
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">G</span>RAY, weather-worn,
      beaten of years, there in the door was my Sicilian! I observed, as he took
      a seat, how he limped, with one leg drawn and distorted. I had him in and
      gave him a chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      My Sicilian and I sat looking one upon the other. It was well-nigh the
      full quarter of a century since I'd clapped eyes on him. And to me the
      thing marvelous was that I did not hate him. What a procession of
      disasters, and he to be its origin, was represented in that little
      weazened man, with his dark skin, monkey-face, and eyes to shine like
      beads! That heart-breaking trial for murder; the death of Apple Cheek;
      Blossom and the mark of the rope;&mdash;all from him! He was the reef upon
      which my life had been cast away! These thoughts ran in my head like a
      mill-race; and yet, I felt only a friendly warmth as though he were some
      good poor friend of long ago.
    </p>
    <p>
      My Sicilian's story was soon told. He had fallen into the hold of a vessel
      and broken his leg. It was mended in so bad a fashion that he must now be
      tied to the shore with it and never sail again. Could I find him work?&mdash;something,
      even a little, by which he might have food and shelter? He put this in a
      manner indescribably plaintive.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then I took a thought full of the whimsical. I would see how far a beaten
      Chief of Tammany Hall might command. There were countless small berths
      about the public offices and courts, where a man might take a meager
      salary, perhaps five hundred dollars a year, for a no greater service than
      throwing up a window or arranging the papers on a desk. These were within
      the appointment of what judges or officers prevailed in the departments or
      courtrooms to which they belonged. I would offer my Sicilian for one.
    </p>
    <p>
      And I had a plan. I knew what should be the fate of the fallen. I had met
      defeat; also, personally, I had been the target of every flinging slander
      which the enemy might invent. It was a time when men would fear my
      friendship as much as on another day they had feared my power. I was an
      Ishmael of politics. The timid and the time-serving would shrink away from
      me.
    </p>
    <p>
      There might, however, be found one who possessed the courage and the
      gratitude, someone whom I had made and who remembered it, to take my
      orders. I decided to search for such a man. Likewise (and this was my
      plan) I resolved&mdash;for I knew better than most folk how the town would
      be in my hands again&mdash;to make that one mayor when a time should
      serve.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come with me,&rdquo; said I. &ldquo;You shall have a berth; and I've nothing now to
      do but seek for it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was a somber comicality to the situation which came close to making
      me laugh&mdash;I, the late dictator, abroad begging a five-hundred-dollar
      place!
    </p>
    <p>
      Twenty men I went to; and if I had been a leper I could not have filled
      them with a broader terror. One and all they would do nothing. These fools
      thought my downfall permanent; they owed everything to me, but forgot it
      on my day of loss. They were of the flock of that Frenchman who was
      grateful only for favors to come. Tarred with the Tammany stick as much as
      was I, myself, each had turned white in a night, and must mimic
      mugwumpery, when now the machine was overborne. Many were those whom I
      marked for slaughter that day; and I may tell you that in a later hour,
      one and all, I knocked them on the head.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now in the finish of it, I discovered one of a gallant fidelity, and who
      was brave above mugwump threat. He was a judge; and, withal, a man
      indomitably honest. But as it is with many bred of the machine, his
      instinct was blindly military. Like Old Mike, he regarded politics as
      another name for war. To the last, he would execute my orders without
      demur.
    </p>
    <p>
      With this judge, I left my Sicilian to dust tables and chairs for forty
      dollars a month. It was the wealth of Dives to the poor broken sailorman,
      and he thanked me with tears on his face. In a secret, lock-fast
      compartment of my memory I put away the name of that judge. He should be
      made first in the town for that one day's work.
    </p>
    <p>
      My late defeat meant, so far as my private matters were involved, nothing
      more serious than a jolt to my self-esteem. Nor hardly that, since I did
      not blame myself for the loss of the election. It was the fortune of
      battle; and because I had seen it on its way, that shaft of regret to
      pierce me was not sharpened of surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      My fortunes were rolling fat with at least three millions of dollars, for
      I had not held the town a decade to neglect my own good. If it had been
      Big Kennedy, now, he would have owned fourfold as much. But I was lavish
      of habit; besides being no such soul of business thrift as was my old
      captain. Three millions should carry me to the end of the journey,
      however, even though I took no more; there would arise no money-worry to
      bark at me. The loss of the town might thin the flanks of my sub-leaders
      of Tammany, but the famine could not touch me.
    </p>
    <p>
      While young Van Flange had been the reason of a deal that was unhappy in
      my destinies, I had never met the boy. Now I was to see him. Morton sent
      him to me on an errand of business; he found me in my own house just as
      dinner was done. I was amiably struck with the look of him. He was tall
      and broad of shoulder, for he had been an athlete in his college and
      tugged at an oar in the boat.
    </p>
    <p>
      My eye felt pleased with young Van Flange from the beginning; he was as
      graceful as an elm, and with a princely set of the head which to my mind
      told the story of good blood. His manner, as he met me, became the
      sublimation of deference, and I could discover in his air a tacit flattery
      that was as positive, even while as impalpable, as a perfume. In his
      attitude, and in all he did and said, one might observe the aristocrat.
      The high strain of him showed as plain as a page of print, and over all a
      clean delicacy that reminded one of a thoroughbred colt.
    </p>
    <p>
      While we were together, Anne and Blossom came into the room. This last was
      a kind of office-place I had at home, where the two often visited with me
      in the evening.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was strange, the color that painted itself in the shy face of Blossom.
      I thought, too, that young Van Flange's interest stood a bit on tiptoe. It
      flashed over me in a moment:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Suppose they were to love and wed?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The question, self-put, discovered nothing rebellious in my breast. I
      would abhor myself as a matchmaker between a boy and a girl; and yet, if I
      did not help events, at least, I wouldn't interrupt them. If it were to
      please Blossom to have him for a husband: why then, God bless the girl,
      and make her day a fair one!
    </p>
    <p>
      Anne, who was quicker than I, must have read the new glow in Blossom's
      face and the new shine in her eyes. But her own face seemed as friendly as
      though the picture gave her no pang, and it reassured me mightily to find
      it so.
    </p>
    <p>
      Young Van Flange made no tiresome stay of it on this evening. But he came
      again, and still again; and once or twice we had him in to dinner. Our
      table appeared to be more complete when he was there; it served to bring
      an evenness and a balance, like a ship in trim. Finally he was in and out
      of the house as free as one of the family.
    </p>
    <p>
      For the earliest time in life, a quiet brightness shone on Blossom that
      was as the sun through mists. As for myself, delight in young Van Flange
      crept upon me like a habit; nor was it made less when I saw how he had a
      fancy for my girl, and that it might turn to wedding bells. The thought
      gave a whiter prospect of hope for Blossom; also it fostered my own peace,
      since my happiness hung utterly by her.
    </p>
    <p>
      One day I put the question of young Van Flange to Morton.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Really, now!&rdquo; said Morton, &ldquo;I should like him vastly if he had a stronger
      under jaw, don't y' know. These fellows with chins like cats' are a
      beastly lot in the long run.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But his habits are now good,&rdquo; I urged. &ldquo;And he is industrious, is he
      not?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course, the puppy works,&rdquo; responded Morton; &ldquo;that is, if you're to
      call pottering at a desk by such a respectable term. As for his habits,
      they are the habits of a captive. He's prisoner to his poverty. Gad! one
      can't be so deucedly pernicious, don't y' know, on nine hundred a year.&rdquo;
       Then, with a burst of eagerness: &ldquo;I know what you would be thinking. But I
      say, old chap, you mustn't bank on his blood. Good on both sides, it may
      be; but the blend is bad. Two very reputable drugs may be combined to make
      a poison, don't y' know!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There the matter stuck; for I would not tell Morton of any feeling my girl
      might have for young Van Flange. However, Morton's view in no wise changed
      my own; I considered that with the best of motives he might still suffer
      from some warping prejudice.
    </p>
    <p>
      There arose a consideration, however, and one I could not look in the
      face. There was that dread birthmark!&mdash;the mark of the rope! At last
      I brought up the topic of my fears with Anne.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will he not loathe her?&rdquo; said I. &ldquo;Will his love not change to hate when
      he knows?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did your love change?&rdquo; Anne asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But that is not the same.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Be at peace, then,&rdquo; returned Anne, taking my hand in hers and pressing
      it. &ldquo;I have told him. Nor shall I forget the nobleness of his reply: 'I
      love Blossom,' said he; 'I love her for her heart.'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When I remember these things, I cannot account for the infatuation of us
      two&mdash;Anne and myself. The blackest villain of earth imposed himself
      upon us as a saint! And I had had my warning. I should have known that he
      who broke a mother's heart would break a wife's.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now when the forces of reform governed the town, affairs went badly for
      that superlative tribe, and each day offered additional claim for the
      return of the machine. Government is not meant to be a shepherd of morals.
      Its primal purposes are of the physical, being no more than to safeguard
      property and person. That is the theory; more strongly still must it
      become the practice if one would avoid the enmity of men. He whose morals
      are looked after by the powers that rule, grows impatient, and in the end,
      vindictive. No mouth likes the bit; a guardian is never loved. The reform
      folk made that error against which Old Mike warned Big Kennedy: They got
      between the public and its beer.
    </p>
    <p>
      The situation, thus phrased, called for neither intrigue nor labor on my
      own part. I had but to stay in my chair, and &ldquo;reform&rdquo; itself would drive
      the people into Tammany's arms.
    </p>
    <p>
      In those days I had but scanty glimpses of the Reverend Bronson. However,
      he now and then would visit me, and when he did, I think I read in his
      troubled brow the fear of machine success next time. Morton was there on
      one occasion when the Reverend Bronson came in. They were well known to
      one another, these two; also, they were friends as much as men might be
      whose lives and aims went wide apart.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now the trouble,&rdquo; observed Morton, as the two discussed that backward
      popularity of the present rule, &ldquo;lies in this: Your purist of politics is
      never practical. He walks the air; and for a principle, he fixes his eyes
      on a star. Besides,&rdquo; concluded Morton, tapping the Reverend Bronson's hand
      with that invaluable eyeglass, &ldquo;you make a pet, at the expense of statutes
      more important, of some beggarly little law like the law against
      gambling.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear sir,&rdquo; exclaimed the Reverend Bronson, &ldquo;surely you do not defend
      gambling.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I defend nothing,&rdquo; said Morton; &ldquo;it's too beastly tiresome, don't y'
      know. But, really, the public is no fool; and with a stock-ticker and a
      bucket shop on every corner, you will hardly excite folk to madness over
      roulette and policy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The policy shops stretch forth their sordid palms for the pennies of the
      very poor,&rdquo; said the Reverend Bronson earnestly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, my boy,&rdquo; retorted Morton, his drooping inanity gaining a color,
      &ldquo;government should be concerned no more about the poor man's penny than
      the rich man's pound. However, if it be a reason, why not suppress the
      barrooms? Gad! what more than your doggery reaches for the pennies of the
      poor?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is truth in what you say,&rdquo; consented the Reverend Bronson
      regretfully. &ldquo;Still, I count for but one as an axman in this wilderness of
      evil; I can fell but one tree at a time. I will tell you this, however: At
      the gates of you rich ones must lie the blame for most of the immoralities
      of the town. You are guilty of two wrongs: You are not benevolent; and you
      set a bad moral example.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Really!&rdquo; replied Morton, &ldquo;I, myself, think the rich a deuced bad lot; in
      fact, I hold them to be quite as bad as the poor, don't y' know. But you
      speak of benevolence&mdash;alms-giving, and that sort of thing. Now I'm
      against benevolence. There is an immorality in alms just in proportion as
      there's a morality to labor. Folk work only because they lack money. Now
      you give a man ten dollars and the beggar will stop work.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let me hear,&rdquo; observed the Reverend Bronson, amused if not convinced,
      &ldquo;what your remedy for the town's bad morals would be.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Work!&rdquo; replied Morton, with quite a flash of animation. &ldquo;I'd make every
      fellow work&mdash;rich and poor alike. I'd invent fardels for the idle.
      The only difference between the rich and the poor is a difference of cooks
      and tailors&mdash;really! Idleness, don't y' know, is everywhere and among
      all classes the certain seed of vice.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You would have difficulty, I fear,&rdquo; remarked the Reverend Bronson, &ldquo;in
      convincing your gilded fellows of the virtuous propriety of labor.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wouldn't convince them, old chap, I'd club them to it. It is a mistake
      you dominies make, that you are all for persuading when you should be for
      driving. Gad! you should never coax where you can drive,&rdquo; and Morton
      smiled vacantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You would deal with men as you do with swine?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What should be more appropriate? Think of the points of resemblance. Both
      are obstinate, voracious, complaining, cowardly, ungrateful, selfish,
      cruel! One should ever deal with a man on a pig basis. Persuasion is
      useless, compliment a waste. You might make a bouquet for him&mdash;orchids
      and violets&mdash;and, gad! he would eat it, thinking it a cabbage. But
      note the pleasing, screaming, scurrying difference when you smite him with
      a brick. Your man and your hog were born knowing all about a brick.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The rich do a deal of harm,&rdquo; remarked the Reverend Bronson thoughtfully.
      &ldquo;Their squanderings, and the brazen spectacle thereof, should be enough of
      themselves to unhinge the morals of mankind. Think on their selfish vulgar
      aggressions! I've seen a lake, once the open joy of thousands, bought and
      fenced to be a play space for one rich man; I've looked on while a village
      where hundreds lived and loved and had their pleasant being, died and
      disappeared to give one rich man room; in the brag and bluster of his
      millions, I've beheld a rich man rearing a shelter for his crazy brain and
      body, and borne witness while he bought lumber yards and planing mills and
      stone quarries and brick concerns and lime kilns with a pretense of
      hastening his building. It is all a disquieting example to the poor man
      looking on. Such folk, dollar-loose and dollar-mad, frame disgrace for
      money, and make the better sentiment of better men fair loathe the name of
      dollar. And yet it is but a sickness, I suppose; a sort of rickets of
      riches&mdash;a Saint Vitus dance of vast wealth! Such go far, however, to
      bear out your parallel of the swine; and at the best, they but pile
      exaggeration on imitation and drink perfumed draff from trough of gold.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Reverend Bronson as he gave us this walked up and down the floor as
      more than once I'd seen him do when moved. Nor did he particularly address
      himself to either myself or Morton until the close, when he turned to that
      latter personage. Pausing in his walk, the Reverend Bronson contemplated
      Morton at some length; and then, as if his thoughts on money had taken
      another path, and shaking his finger in the manner of one who preferred an
      indictment, he said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cato, the Censor, declared: 'It is difficult to save that city from ruin
      where a fish sells for more than an ox.' By the bad practices of your
      vulgar rich, that, to-day, is a description of New York. Still, from the
      public standpoint, I should not call the luxury it tells of, the worst
      effect of wealth, nor the riches which indulge in such luxury the most
      baleful riches. There be those other busy black-flag millions which maraud
      a people. They cut their way through bars and bolts of government with the
      saws and files and acids of their evil influence&mdash;an influence whose
      expression is ever, and simply, bribes. I speak of those millions that
      purchase the passage of one law or the downfall of another, and which buy
      the people's officers like cattle to their will. But even as I reproach
      those criminal millions, I marvel at their blindness. Cannot such wealth
      see that in its treasons&mdash;for treason it does as much as any Arnold&mdash;it
      but undermines itself? Who should need strength and probity in government,
      and the shelter of them, more than Money? And yet in its rapacity without
      eyes, it must ever be using the criminal avarice of officials to pick the
      stones and mortar from the honest foundations of the state!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Reverend Bronson resumed his walking up and down. Morton, the
      imperturbable, lighted a cigarette and puffed bland puffs as though he in
      no fashion felt himself described. Not at all would he honor the notion
      that the reverend rhetorician was talking either of him or at him, in his
      condemnation of those pirate millions.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should feel alarmed for my country,&rdquo; continued the Reverend Bronson,
      coming back to his chair, &ldquo;if I did not remember that New York is not the
      nation, and how a sentiment here is never the sentiment there. The country
      at large has still its ideals; New York, I fear, has nothing save its
      appetites.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To shift discussion,&rdquo; said Morton lightly, &ldquo;a discussion that would seem
      academic rather than practical, and coming to the City and what you call
      its appetites, let me suggest this: Much of that trouble of which you
      speak arises by faults of politics as the latter science is practiced by
      the parties. Take yourself and our silent friend.&rdquo; Here Morton indicated
      me: &ldquo;Take the two parties you represent. Neither was ever known to propose
      an onward step. Each of you has for his sole issue the villainies of the
      other fellow; the whole of your cry is the iniquity of the opposition; it
      is really! I'll give both of you this for a warning. The future is to see
      the man who, leaving a past to bury a. past, will cry 'Public Ownership!'
      or some equally engaging slogan. Gad! old chap, with that, the rabble will
      follow him as the rats followed the pied piper of Hamelin. The moralist
      and the grafter will both be left, don't y' know!&rdquo; Morton here returned
      into that vapidity from which, for the moment, he had shaken himself free.
      &ldquo;Gad!&rdquo; he concluded, &ldquo;you will never know what a passion to own things
      gnaws at your peasant in his blouse and wooden shoes until some prophetic
      beggar shouts 'Public Ownership!' you won't, really!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sticking to what you term the practical,&rdquo; said the Reverend Bronson,
      &ldquo;tell me wherein our reform administration has weakened itself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As I've observed,&rdquo; responded Morton, &ldquo;you pick out a law and make a pet
      of it, to the neglect of criminal matters more important. It is your fad&mdash;your
      vanity of party, to do this. Also, it is your heel of Achilles, and
      through it will come your death-blow.&rdquo; Then, as if weary of the serious,
      Morton went off at a lively tangent: &ldquo;Someone&mdash;a very good person,
      too, I think, although I've mislaid his name&mdash;observed: 'Oh, that
      mine enemy would write a book!' Now I should make it: 'Oh, that mine enemy
      would own a fad!' Given a fellow's fad, I've got him. Once upon a time,
      when I had a measure of great railway moment&mdash;really! one of those
      measures of black-flag millions, don't y' know!&mdash;pending before the
      legislature at Albany, I ran into a gentleman whose name was De Vallier.
      Most surprising creature, this De Vallier! Disgustingly honest, too; but
      above all, as proud as a Spanish Hidalgo of his name. Said his ancestors
      were nobles of France under the Grand Monarch, and that sort of thing.
      Gad! it was his fad&mdash;this name! And the bitterness wherewith he
      opposed my measure was positively shameful. Really, if the floor of the
      Assembly&mdash;the chap was in the Assembly, don't y' know&mdash;were left
      unguarded for a moment, De Vallier would occupy it, and call everybody but
      himself a venal rogue of bribes. There was never anything more shocking!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I hit upon an expedient. If I could but touch his fad&mdash;if I
      might but reach that name of De Vallier, I would have him on the hip. So
      with that, don't y' know, I had a bill introduced to change the fellow's
      name to Dummeldinger. I did, 'pon my honor! The Assembly adopted it gladly.
      The Senate was about to do the same, when the horrified De Vallier threw
      himself at my feet. He would die if he were called Dummeldinger!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The poor fellow's grief affected me very much; my sympathies are easily
      excited&mdash;they are, really! And Dummeldinger was such a beastly name!
      I couldn't withstand De Vallier's pleadings. I caused the bill changing
      his name to be withdrawn, and in the fervor of his gratitude, De Vallier
      voted for that railway measure. It was my kindness that won him; in his
      relief to escape 'Dummeldinger,' De Vallier was ready to die for me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was evening, and in the younger hours I had pulled my chair before the
      blaze, and was thinking on Apple Cheek, and how I would give the last I
      owned of money and power to have her by me. This was no uncommon train;
      I've seen few days since she died that did not fill my memory with her
      image.
    </p>
    <p>
      Outside raged a threshing storm of snow that was like a threat for
      bitterness, and it made the sticks in the fireplace snap and sparkle in a
      kind of stout defiance, as though inviting it to do its worst.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the next room were Anne and Blossom, and with them young Van Flange. I
      could hear the murmur of their voices, and at intervals a little laugh
      from him.
    </p>
    <p>
      An hour went by; the door between opened, and young Van Flange, halting a
      bit with hesitation that was not without charm, stepped into my presence.
      He spoke with grace and courage, however, when once he was launched, and
      told me his love and asked for Blossom. Then my girl came, and pressed her
      face to mine. Anne, too, was there, like a blessing and a hope.
    </p>
    <p>
      They were married:&mdash;my girl and young Van Flange. Morton came to my
      aid; and I must confess that it was he, with young Van Flange, who helped
      us to bridesmaids and ushers, and what others belong with weddings in
      their carrying out. I had none upon whom I might call when now I needed
      wares of such fine sort; while Blossom, for her part, living her
      frightened life of seclusion, was as devoid of acquaintances or friends
      among the fashionables as any abbess might have been.
    </p>
    <p>
      The street was thronged with people when we drove up, and inside the
      church was such a jam of roses and folk as I had never beheld. Wide was
      the curious interest in the daughter of Tammany's Chief; and Blossom must
      have felt it, for her hand fluttered like a bird on my arm as, with organ
      crashing a wedding march, I led her up the aisle. At the altar rail were
      the bishop and three priests. And so, I gave my girl away.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the ceremony was done, we all went back to my house&mdash;Blossom's
      house, since I had put it in her name&mdash;for I would have it that they
      must live with me. I was not to be cheated of my girl; she should not be
      lost out of my arms because she had found a husband's. It wrought a mighty
      peace for me, this wedding, showing as it did so sure of happiness to
      Blossom. Nor will I say it did not feed my pride. Was it a slight thing
      that the blood of the Clonmel smith should unite itself with a strain, old
      and proud and blue beyond any in the town? We made one family of it; and
      when we were settled, my heart filled up with a feeling more akin to
      content than any that had dwelt there for many a sore day.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXIV&mdash;HOW VAN FLANGE WENT INTO STOCKS
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">I</span>T was by the
      suggestion of young Van Flange himself that he became a broker. His
      argument I think was sound; he had been bred to no profession, and the
      floor of the Exchange, if he would have a trade, was all that was left
      him. No one could be of mark or consequence in New York who might not
      write himself master of millions. Morton himself said that; and with
      commerce narrowing to a huddle of mammoth corporations, how should anyone
      look forward to the conquest of millions save through those avenues of
      chance which Wall Street alone provided? The Stock Exchange was all that
      remained; and with that, I bought young Van Flange a seat therein, and
      equipped him for a brokerage career. I harbored no misgivings of his
      success; no one could look upon his clean, handsome outlines and maintain
      a doubt.
    </p>
    <p>
      Those were our happiest days&mdash;Blossom's and mine. In her name, I
      split my fortune in two, and gave young Van Flange a million and a half
      wherewith to arm his hands for the fray of stocks. Even now, as I look
      backward through the darkness, I still think it a million and a half well
      spent. For throughout those slender months of sunshine, Blossom went to
      and fro about me, radiating a subdued warmth of joy that was like the
      silent glow of a lamp. Yes, that money served its end. It made Blossom
      happy, and it will do me good while I live to think how that was so.
    </p>
    <p>
      Morton, when I called young Van Flange from his Mulberry desk to send him
      into Wall Street, was filled with distrust of the scheme.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You should have him stay with Mulberry,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;If he do no good, at
      least he will do no harm, and that, don't y' know, is a business record
      far above the average. Besides, he's safer; he is, really!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This I did not like from Morton. He himself was a famous man of stocks,
      and had piled millions upon millions in a pyramid of speculation. Did he
      claim for himself a monopoly of stock intelligence? Van Flange was as well
      taught of books as was he, and came of a better family. Was it that he
      arrogated to his own head a superiority of wit for finding his way about
      in those channels of stock value? I said something of this sorb to Morton.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Believe me, old chap,&rdquo; said he, laying his slim hand on my shoulder,
      &ldquo;believe me, I had nothing on my mind beyond your own safety, and the
      safety of that cub of yours. And I think you will agree that I have
      exhibited a knowledge of what winds and currents and rocks might interrupt
      or wreck one in his voyages after stocks.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Admitting all you say,&rdquo; I replied, &ldquo;it does not follow that another may
      not know or learn to know as much.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But Wall Street is such a quicksand,&rdquo; he persisted. &ldquo;Gad! it swallows
      nine of every ten who set foot in it. And to deduce safety for another,
      because I am and have been safe, might troll you into error. You should
      consider my peculiar case. I was born with beak and claw for the game.
      Like the fish-hawk, I can hover above the stream of stocks, and swoop in
      and out, taking my quarry where it swims. And then, remember my
      arrangements. I have an agent at the elbow of every opportunity. I have
      made the world my spy, since I pay the highest price for information. If a
      word be said in a cabinet, I hear it; if a decision of court is to be
      handed down, I know it; if any of our great forces or monarchs of the
      street so much as move a finger, I see it. And yet, with all I know, and
      all I see, and all I hear, and all my nets and snares as complicated as
      the works of a watch, added to a native genius, the best I may do is win
      four times in seven. In Wall Street, a man meets with not alone the
      foreseeable, but the unforeseeable; he does, really! He is like a man in a
      tempest, and may be struck dead by some cloud-leveled bolt while you and
      he stand talking, don't y' know!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Morton fell a long day's journey short of convincing me that Wall Street
      was a theater of peril for young Van Flange. Moreover, the boy said true;
      it offered the one way open to his feet. Thus reasoning, and led by my
      love for my girl and my delight to think how she was happy, I did all I
      might to further the ambitions of young Van Flange, and embark him as a
      trader of stocks. He took office rooms in Broad Street; and on the one or
      two occasions when I set foot in them, I was flattered as well as amazed
      by the array of clerks and stock-tickers, blackboards, and tall baskets,
      which met my untaught gaze. The scene seemed to buzz and vibrate with
      prosperity, and the air was vital of those riches which it promised.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is scarce required that I say I paid not the least attention to young
      Van Flange and his business affairs. I possessed no stock knowledge, being
      as darkened touching Wall Street as any Hottentot. More than that, my time
      was taken up with Tammany Hall. The flow of general feeling continued to
      favor a return of the machine, for the public was becoming more and sorely
      irked of a misfit &ldquo;reform&rdquo; that was too tight in one place while too loose
      in another. There stood no doubt of it; I had only to wait and maintain my
      own lines in order, and the town would be my own again. It would yet lie
      in my lap like a goose in the lap of a Dutch woman; and I to feather-line
      my personal nest with its plumage to what soft extent I would. For all
      that, I must watch lynx-like my own forces, guarding against schism,
      keeping my people together solidly for the battle that was to be won.
    </p>
    <p>
      Much and frequently, I discussed the situation with Morton. With his
      traction operations, he had an interest almost as deep as my own. He was,
      too, the one man on whose wisdom of politics I had been educated to rely.
      When it became a question of votes and how to get them, I had yet to meet
      Morton going wrong.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You should have an issue,&rdquo; said Morton. &ldquo;You should not have two, for the
      public is like a dog, don't y' know, and can chase no more than just one
      rabbit at a time. But one you should have&mdash;something you could point
      to and promise for the future. As affairs stand&mdash;and gad! it has been
      that way since I have had a memory&mdash;you and the opposition will go
      into the campaign like a pair of beldame scolds, railing at one another.
      Politics has become a contest of who can throw the most mud. Really, the
      town is beastly tired of both of you&mdash;it is, 'pon my word!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now what issue would you offer?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you recall what I told our friend Bronson? Public Ownership should be
      the great card. Go in for the ownership by the town of street railways,
      water works, gas plants, and that sort of thing, don't y' know, and the
      rabble will trample on itself to vote your ticket.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And do you shout 'Municipal Ownership!'&mdash;you with a street railway
      to lose?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I wouldn't lose it. I'm not talking of anything but an issue. It
      would be a deuced bore, if Public Ownership actually were to happen.
      Besides, for me to lose my road would be the worst possible form! No, I'm
      not so insane as that. But it doesn't mean, because you make Public
      Ownership an issue, that you must bring it about. There are always ways to
      dodge, don't y' know. And the people won't care; the patient beggars have
      been taught to expect it. An issue is like the bell-ringing before an
      auction; it is only meant to call a crowd. Once the auction begins, no one
      remembers the bell-ringing; they don't, really!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To simply shout 'Public Ownership:'&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;would hardly stir the
      depths. We would have to get down to something practical&mdash;something
      definite.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was the point I was approaching. Really! what should be better now
      than to plainly propose&mdash;since the route is unoccupied, and offers a
      field of cheapest experiment&mdash;a street railway with a loop around
      Washington Square, and then out Fifth Avenue to One Hundred and Tenth
      Street, next west on One Hundred and Tenth Street to Seventh Avenue, and
      lastly north on Seventh Avenue until you strike the Harlem River at the
      One Hundred and Fifty-fifth Street bridge?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What a howl would go up from Fifth Avenue!&rdquo; said I.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If it were so, what then? You are not to be injured by silk-stocking
      clamor. For each cry against you from the aristocrats, twenty of the
      peasantry would come crying to your back; don't y', know! Patrician
      opposition, old chap, means ever plebeian support, and you should do all
      you may, with wedge and maul of policy, to split the log along those
      lines. Gad!&rdquo; concluded Morton, bursting suddenly into self-compliments; &ldquo;I
      don't recall when I was so beastly sagacious before&mdash;really!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now I fail to go with you,&rdquo; I returned. &ldquo;I have for long believed that
      the strongest force with which the organization had to contend, was its
      own lack of fashion. If Tammany had a handful or two of that purple and
      fine linen with which you think it so wise to quarrel, it might rub some
      of the mud off itself, and have quieter if not fairer treatment from a
      press, ever ready to truckle to the town's nobility. Should we win next
      time, it is already in my plans to establish a club in the very heart of
      Fifth Avenue. I shall attract thither all the folk of elegant fashion I
      can, so that, thereafter, should one snap a kodak on the machine, the
      foreground of the picture will contain a respectable exhibition of lofty
      names. I want, rather, to get Tammany out of the gutter, than arrange for
      its perpetual stay therein.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Old chap,&rdquo; said Morton, glorying through his eyeglass, &ldquo;I think I shall
      try a cigarette after that. I need it to resettle my nerves; I do, really.
      Why, my dear boy! do you suppose that Tammany can be anything other than
      that unwashed black sheep it is? We shall make bishops of burglars when
      that day dawns. The thing's wildly impossible, don't y' know! Besides,
      your machine would die. Feed Tammany Hall on any diet of an aristocracy,
      and you will unhinge its stomach; you will, 'pon my faith!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You shall see a Tammany club in fashion's center, none the less.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you don't like 'Public Ownership?'&rdquo; observed Morton, after a pause,
      the while twirling his eyeglass. &ldquo;Why don't you then go in for cutting the
      City off from the State, and making a separate State of it? You could say
      that we suffer from hayseed tyranny, and all that. Really! it's the truth,
      don't y' know; and besides, we City fellows would gulp it down like spring
      water.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The City delegation in Albany,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;is too small to put through such
      a bill. The Cornfields would be a unit to smother it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not so sure about the Cornfields!&rdquo; cried Morton. &ldquo;Of course it would take
      money. That provided, think of the wires you could pull. Here are a
      half-dozen railroads, with their claws and teeth in the country and their
      tails in town. Each of them, don't y' know, as part of its equipment, owns
      a little herd of rustic members. You could step on the railroad tail with
      the feet of your fifty city departments, and torture it into giving you
      its hayseed marionettes for this scheme of a new State. Pon my word! old
      chap, it could be brought about; it could, really!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I fear,&rdquo; said I banteringly, &ldquo;that after all you are no better than a
      harebrained theorist. I confess that your plans are too grand for my
      commonplace powers of execution. I shall have to plod on with those
      moss-grown methods which have served us in the past.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It would seem as though I had had Death to be my neighbor from the
      beginning, for his black shadow was in constant play about me. One day he
      would take a victim from out my very arms; again he would grimly step
      between me and another as we sat in talk. Nor did doctors do much good or
      any; and I have thought that all I shall ask, when my own time comes, is a
      nurse to lift me in and out of bed, and for the rest of it, why! let me
      die.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was Anne to leave me now, and her death befell like lightning from an
      open sky. Anne was never of your robust women; I should not have said,
      however, that she was frail, since she was always about, taking the whole
      weight of the house to herself, and, as I found when she was gone,
      furnishing the major portion of its cheerfulness. That was what misled me,
      doubtless; a brave smile shone ever on her face like sunlight, and served
      to put me off from any thought of sickness for her.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was her heart, they said; but no such slowness in striking as when Big
      Kennedy died. Anne had been abroad for a walk in the early cool of the
      evening. When she returned, and without removing her street gear, she sank
      into a chair in the hall.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What ails ye, mem?&rdquo; asked the old Galway wife that had been nurse to
      Blossom, and who undid the door to Anne; &ldquo;what's the matter of your pale
      face?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An' then,&rdquo; cried the crone, when she gave me the sorry tale of it, &ldquo;she
      answered wit' a sob. An' next her poor head fell back on the chair, and
      she was by.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Both young Van Flange and I were away from the house at the time of it; he
      about his business, which kept him often, and long, into the night; and I
      in the smothering midst of my politics. When I was brought home, they had
      laid Anne's body on her bed. At the foot on a rug crouched the old nurse,
      rocking herself forward and back, wailing like a banshee. Blossom, whose
      cheek was whitened with the horror of our loss, crept to my side and stood
      close, clutching my hand as in those old terror-ridden baby days when
      unseen demons glowered from the room-comers. It was no good sight for
      Blossom, and I led her away, the old Galway crone at the bed's foot
      keening her barbarous mourning after us far down the hall.
    </p>
    <p>
      Blossom was all that remained with me now. And yet, she would be enough, I
      thought, as I held her, child-fashion, in my arms that night to comfort
      her, if only I might keep her happy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Young Van Flange worked at his trade of stocks like a horse. He was into
      it early and late, sometimes staying from home all night. I took pride to
      think how much more wisely than Morton I had judged the boy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Those night absences, when he did not come in until three of the morning,
      and on occasion not at all, gave me no concern. My own business of Tammany
      was quite as apt to hold me; for there are events that must be dealt with
      in the immediate, like shooting a bird on the wing. A multitude of such
      were upon me constantly, and there was no moment of the day or night that
      I could say beforehand would not be claimed by them. When this was my own
      case, it turned nothing difficult to understand how the exigencies of
      stocks might be as peremptory.
    </p>
    <p>
      One matter to promote a growing fund of confidence in young Van Flange was
      his sobriety. The story ran&mdash;and, in truth, his own mother had told
      it&mdash;of his drunkenness, when a boy fresh out of his books, and during
      those Barclay Street days when he went throwing his patrimony to the
      vultures. That was by and done with; he had somehow gotten by the bottle.
      Never but once did he show the flush of liquor, and that fell out when he
      had been to a college dinner. I had always understood how it was the
      custom to retire drunk from such festivals, wherefore that particular
      inebriety gave me scant uneasiness. One should not expect a roaring boy
      about town to turn deacon in a day.
    </p>
    <p>
      Blossom was, as I've said, by nature shy and secret, and never one to
      relate her joys or griefs. While she and he were under the same roof with
      me, I had no word from her as to her life with young Van Flange, and
      whether it went bright, or was blurred of differences. Nor do I believe
      that in those days there came aught to harrow her, unless it were the
      feeling that young Van Flange showed less the lover and more like folk of
      fifty than she might have wished.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once and again, indeed, I caught on her face a passing shade; but her eyes
      cleared when I looked at her, and she would come and put her arms about
      me, and by that I could not help but see how her marriage had flowered
      life's path for her. This thought of itself would set off a tune in my
      heart like the songs of birds; and I have it the more sharply upon my
      memory, because it was the one deep happiness I knew. The shadows I
      trapped as they crossed the brow of Blossom, I laid to a thought that
      young Van Flange carried too heavy a load of work. It might break him in
      his health; and the fear had warrant in hollow eyes and a thin sallowness
      of face, which piled age upon him, and made him resemble twice his years.
    </p>
    <p>
      Towards me, the pose of young Van Flange was that one of respectful
      deference which had marked him from the start. Sometimes I was struck by
      the notion that he was afraid of me; not with any particularity of alarm,
      but as a woman might fear a mastiff, arguing peril from latent ferocities
      and a savagery of strength.
    </p>
    <p>
      Still, he in no wise ran away; one is not to understand that; on the
      contrary he would pass hours in my society, explaining his speculations
      and showing those figures which were the record of his profits. I was glad
      to listen, too; for while I did not always grasp a meaning, being
      stock-dull as I've explained, what he said of &ldquo;bull&rdquo; and &ldquo;bear&rdquo; and
      &ldquo;short&rdquo; and &ldquo;long,&rdquo; had the smell of combat about it, and held me
      enthralled like a romance.
    </p>
    <p>
      There were instances when he suggested speculations, and now and then as
      high as one thousand shares. I never failed to humor him, for I thought a
      negative might smack of lack of confidence&mdash;a thing I would not think
      of, if only for love of Blossom. I must say that my belief in young Van
      Flange was augmented by these deals, which turned unflaggingly, though
      never largely, to my credit.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was when I stood waist-deep in what arrangements were preliminary to my
      battle for the town, now drawing near and nearer, that young Van Flange
      approached me concerning Blackberry Traction.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Father,&rdquo; said he&mdash;for he called me &ldquo;father,&rdquo; and the name was
      pleasant to my ear&mdash;&ldquo;father, if you will, we may make millions of
      dollars like turning hand or head.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then he gave me a long story of the friendship he had scraped together
      with the president of Blackberry&mdash;he of the Hebrew cast and clutch,
      whom I once met and disappointed over franchises.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; said young Van Flange, &ldquo;while he is the president of
      Blackberry, he has no sentimental feelings concerning the fortunes of the
      company. He is as sharp to make money as either you or I. The truth is
      this: While the stock is quoted fairly high, Blackberry in fact is in a
      bad way. It is like a house of cards, and a kick would collapse it into
      ruins. The president, because we are such intimates, gave me the whole
      truth of Blackberry. Swearing me to secrecy, he, as it were, lighted a
      lantern, and led me into the darkest corners. He showed me the books.
      Blackberry is on the threshold of a crash. The dividends coming due will
      not be paid. It is behind in its interest; and the directors will be
      driven to declare an immense issue of bonds. Blackberry stock will fall
      below twenty; a receiver will have the road within the year. To my mind,
      the situation is ready for a coup. We have but to sell and keep selling,
      to take in what millions we will.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was further talk, and all to similar purpose. Also, I recalled the
      ease with which Morton and I, aforetime, took four millions between us out
      of Blackberry.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now I think,&rdquo; said I, in the finish of it, &ldquo;that Blackberry is my gold
      mine by the word of Fate itself. Those we are to make will not be the
      first riches I've had from it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Except the house we stood in, I owned no real estate; nor yet that, since
      it was Blossom's, being her marriage gift from me. From the first I had
      felt an aversion for houses and lots. I was of no stomach to collect
      rents, squabble with tenants over repairs, or race to magistrates for
      eviction. This last I should say was the Irish in my arteries, for
      landlords had hectored my ancestors like horseflies. My wealth was all in
      stocks and bonds; nor would I listen to anything else. Morton had his own
      whimsical explanation for this:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There be those among us,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;who are nomads by instinct&mdash;a
      sort of white Arab, don't y' know. Not intending offense&mdash;for, gad!
      there are reasons why I desire to keep you good-natured&mdash;every
      congenital criminal is of that sort; he is, really! Such folk
      instinctively look forward to migration or flight. They want nothing they
      can't pack up and depart with in a night, and would no more take a deed to
      land than a dose of arsenic. It's you who are of those migratory people.
      That's why you abhor real estate. Fact, old chap! you're a born nomad; and
      it's in your blood to be ever ready to strike camp, inspan your teams, and
      trek.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Morton furnished these valuable theories when he was investing my money
      for me. Having no belief in my own investment wisdom, I imposed the task
      upon his good nature. One day he brought me my complete possessions in a
      wonderful sheaf of securities. They were edged, each and all, with gold,
      since Morton would accept no less.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There you are, my boy,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;and everything as clean as running
      water, don't y' know. Really, I didn't think you could be trusted, if it
      came on to blow a panic, so I've bought for you only stuff that can
      protect itself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When young Van Flange made his Blackberry suggestions, I should say I had
      sixteen hundred thousand dollars worth of these bonds and stocks&mdash;mostly
      the former&mdash;in my steel box. I may only guess concerning it, for I
      could not reckon so huge a sum to the precise farthing. It was all in the
      same house with us; I kept it in a safe I'd fitted into the walls, and
      which was so devised as to laugh at either a burglar or a fire. I gave
      young Van Flange the key of that interior compartment which held these
      securities; the general combination he already possessed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There you'll find more than a million and a half,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;and that,
      with what you have, should make three millions. How much Blackberry can
      you sell now?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We ought to sell one hundred and fifty thousand shares. A drop of eighty
      points, and it will go that far, would bring us in twelve millions.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do what you think best,&rdquo; said I. &ldquo;And, mind you: No word to Morton.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now I was about to suggest that,&rdquo; said young Van Flange.
    </p>
    <p>
      Morton should not know what was on my slate for Blackberry. Trust him?
      yes; and with every hope I had. But it was my vanity to make this move
      without him. I would open his eyes to it, that young Van Flange, if not so
      old a sailor as himself, was none the less his equal at charting a course
      and navigating speculation across that sea of stocks, about the
      treacherous dangers whereof it had pleased him so often to patronize me.

      CHAPTER XXV&mdash;PROFIT AND LOSS; MAINLY THE LATTER
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">S</span>INCE time began,
      no man, not even a king, has been better obeyed in his mandates, than was
      I while Chief of Tammany Hall. From high to low, from the leader of a
      district to the last mean straggler in the ranks, one and all, they pulled
      and hauled or ran and climbed like sailors in a gale, at the glance of my
      eye or the toss of my finger. More often than once, I have paused in
      wonder over this blind submission, and asked myself the reason.
      Particularly, since I laid down my chiefship, the query has come upon my
      tongue while I remembered old days, to consider how successes might have
      been more richly improved or defeats, in their disasters, at least
      partially avoided.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nor could I give myself the answer. I had no close friendships among my
      men; none of them was my confidant beyond what came to be demanded of the
      business in our hands. On the contrary, there existed a gulf between me
      and those about me, and while I was civil&mdash;for I am not the man, and
      never was, of wordy violences&mdash;I can call myself nothing more.
    </p>
    <p>
      If anything, I should say my people of politics feared me, and that a sort
      of sweating terror was the spur to send them flying when I gave an order.
      There was respect, too; and in some cases a kind of love like a dog's
      love, and which is rather the homage paid by weakness to strength, or that
      sentiment offered of the vine to the oak that supports its clamberings.
    </p>
    <p>
      Why my men should stand in awe of me, I cannot tell. Certainly, I was
      mindful of their rights; and, with the final admonitions of Big Kennedy in
      my ears, I avoided favoritisms and dealt out justice from an even hand.
      True, I could be stern when occasion invited, and was swift to destroy
      that one whose powers did not match his duty, or who for a bribe would
      betray, or for an ambition would oppose, my plan.
    </p>
    <p>
      No; after Big Kennedy's death, I could name you none save Morton whose
      advice I cared for, or towards whom I leaned in any thought of confidence.
      Some have said that this distance, which I maintained between me and my
      underlings, was the secret of my strength. It may have been; and if it
      were I take no credit, since I expressed nothing save a loneliness of
      disposition, and could not have borne myself otherwise had I made the
      attempt. Not that I regretted it. That dumb concession of themselves to
      me, by my folk of Tammany, would play no little part in pulling down a
      victory in the great conflict wherein we were about to engage.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tammany Hall was never more sharply organized. I worked over the business
      like an artist over an etching. Discipline was brought to a pitch never
      before known. My district leaders were the pick of the covey, and every
      one, for force and talents of executive kind, fit to lead a brigade into
      battle. Under these were the captains of election precincts; and a rank
      below the latter came the block captains&mdash;one for each city block.
      Thus were made up those wheels within wheels which, taken together,
      completed the machine. They fitted one with the other, block captains with
      precinct captains, the latter with district leaders, and these last with
      myself; and all like the wheels and springs and ratchets and regulators of
      a clock; one sure, too, when wound and oiled and started, to strike the
      hours and announce the time of day in local politics with a nicety that
      owned no precedent.
    </p>
    <p>
      There would be a quartette of tickets; I could see that fact of four
      corners in its approach, long months before the conventions. Besides the
      two regular parties, and the mugwump-independents&mdash;which tribe, like
      the poor, we have always with us&mdash;the laborites would try again.
      These had not come to the field in any force since that giant uprising
      when we beat them down with the reputable old gentleman. Nor did I fear
      them now. My trained senses told me, as with thumb on wrist I counted the
      public pulse, how those clans of labor were not so formidable by
      three-fourths as on that other day a decade and more before.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of those three camps of politics set over against us, that one to be the
      strongest was the party of reform. This knowledge swelled my stock of
      courage, already mounting high. If it were no more than to rout the
      administration now worrying the withers of the town, why, then! the
      machine was safe to win.
    </p>
    <p>
      There arose another sign. As the days ran on, rich and frequent, first
      from one big corporation and then another&mdash;and these do not give
      until they believe&mdash;the contributions of money came rolling along.
      They would buy our favor in advance of victory. These donations followed
      each other like billows upon a beach, and each larger than the one before,
      which showed how the wind of general confidence was rising in our favor.
      It was not, therefore, my view alone; but, by this light of money to our
      cause, I could see how the common opinion had begun to gather head that
      the machine was to take the town again.
    </p>
    <p>
      This latter is often a decisive point, and one to give victory of itself.
      The average of intelligence and integrity in this city of New York is
      lower than any in the land. There are here, in proportion to a vote, more
      people whose sole principle is the bandwagon, than in any other town
      between the oceans. These &ldquo;sliders,&rdquo; who go hither and yon, and attach
      themselves to this standard or ally themselves with that one, as the eye
      of their fancy is caught and taught by some fluttering signal of the hour
      to pick the winning side, are enough of themselves to decide a contest.
      Wherefore, to promote this advertisement among creatures of chameleon
      politics, of an approaching triumph for the machine, and it being possible
      because of those contributed thousands coming so early into my chests, I
      began furnishing funds to my leaders and setting them to the work of their
      regions weeks before the nearest of our enemies had begun to think on his
      ticket.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was another argument for putting out this money. The noses of my
      people had been withheld from the cribs of office for hungry months upon
      months. The money would arouse an appetite and give their teeth an edge. I
      looked for fine work, too, since the leanest wolves are ever foremost in
      the hunt.
    </p>
    <p>
      Emphatically did I lay it upon my leaders that, man for man, they must
      count their districts. They must tell over each voter as a churchman tells
      his beads. They must give me a true story of the situation, and I promised
      grief to him who brought me mistaken word. I will say in their compliment
      that, by the reports of my leaders on the day before the poll, I counted
      the machine majority exact within four hundred votes; and that, I may tell
      you, with four tickets in the conflict, and a whole count which was
      measured by hundreds of thousands, is no light affair. I mention it to
      evidence the hair-line perfection to which the methods of the machine had
      been brought.
    </p>
    <p>
      More than one leader reported within five votes of his majority, and none
      went fifty votes astray.
    </p>
    <p>
      You think we overdid ourselves to the point ridiculous, in this breathless
      solicitude of preparation? Man! the wealth of twenty Ophirs hung upon the
      hazard. I was in no mood to lose, if skill and sleepless forethought, and
      every intrigue born of money, might serve to bring success.
    </p>
    <p>
      Morton&mdash;that best of prophets!&mdash;believed in the star of the
      machine.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This time,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I shall miss the agony of contributing to the other
      fellows, don't y' know. It will be quite a relief&mdash;really! I must
      say, old chap, that I like the mugwump less and less the more I see of
      him. He's so deucedly respectable, for one thing! Gad! there are times
      when a mugwump carries respectability to a height absolutely incompatible
      with human existence. Besides, he is forever walking a crack and calling
      it a principle. I get tired of a chalkline morality. It's all such deuced
      rot; it bores me to death; it does, really! One begins to appreciate the
      amiable, tolerant virtues of easy, old-shoe vice.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Morton, worn with this long harangue, was moved to recruit his moody
      energies with the inevitable cigarette. He puffed recuperative puffs for a
      space, and then he began:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What an angelic ass is this city of New York! Why! it doesn't know as
      much as a horse! Any ignorant teamster of politics can harness it, and
      haul with it, and head it what way he will. I say, old chap, what are the
      round-number expenses of the town a year?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;About one hundred and twenty-five millions.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One hundred and twenty-five millions&mdash;really! Do you happen to know
      the aggregate annual profits of those divers private companies that
      control and sell us our water, and lighting, and telephone, and telegraph,
      and traction services?&mdash;saying nothing of ferries, and paving, and
      all that? It's over one hundred and fifty millions a year, don't y' know!
      More than enough to run the town without a splinter of tax&mdash;really!
      That's why I exclaim in rapture over the public's accommodating
      imbecility. Now, if a private individual were to manage his affairs so
      much like a howling idiot, his heirs would clap him in a padded cell, and
      serve the beggar right.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think, however,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;that you have been one to profit by those
      same idiocies of the town.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Millions, my boy, millions! And I'm going in for more, don't y' know.
      There are a half-dozen delicious things I have my eye on. Gad! I shall
      have my hand on them, the moment you take control.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I make you welcome in advance,&rdquo; said I. &ldquo;Give me but the town again, and
      you shall pick and choose.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In season, I handed my slate of names to the nominating committee to be
      handed by them to the convention.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the head, for the post of mayor, was written the name of that bold
      judge who, in the presence of my enemies and on a day when I was down, had
      given my Sicilian countenance. Such folk are the choice material of the
      machine. Their characters invite the public; while, for their courage, and
      that trick to be military and go with closed eyes to the execution of an
      order, the machine can rely upon them through black and white. My judge
      when mayor would accept my word for the last appointment and the last
      contract in his power, and think it duty.
    </p>
    <p>
      And who shall say that he would err? It was the law of the machine; he was
      the man of the machine; for the public, which accepted him, he was the
      machine. It is the machine that offers for every office on the list; the
      ticket is but the manner or, if you please, the mask. Nor is this secret.
      Who shall complain then, or fasten him with charges, when my judge, made
      mayor, infers a public's instruction to regard himself as the vizier of
      the machine?&mdash;its hand and voice for the town's government?
    </p>
    <p>
      It stood the day before the polls, and having advantage of the usual lull
      I was resting myself at home. Held fast by the hooks of politics, I for
      weeks had not seen young Van Flange, and had gotten only glimpses of
      Blossom. While lounging by my fire&mdash;for the day was raw, with a wind
      off the Sound that smelled of winter&mdash;young Van Flange drove to the
      door in a brougham.
    </p>
    <p>
      That a brisk broker should visit his house at an hour when the floor of
      the Exchange was tossing with speculation, would be the thing not looked
      for; but I was too much in a fog of politics, and too ignorant of stocks
      besides, to make the observation. Indeed, I was glad to see the boy,
      greeting him with a trifle more warmth than common.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now I thought he gave me his hand with a kind of shiver of reluctance.
      This made me consider. Plainly, he was not at ease as we sat together.
      Covering him with the tail of my eye, I could note how his face carried a
      look, at once timid and malignant.
    </p>
    <p>
      I could not read the meaning, and remained silent a while with the mere
      riddle of it. Was he ill? The lean yellowness of his cheek, and the dark
      about the hollow eyes, were a hint that way, to which the broken stoop of
      the shoulders gave added currency.
    </p>
    <p>
      Young Van Flange continued silent; not, however, in a way to promise
      sullenness, but as though his feelings were a gag to him. At last I
      thought, with a word of my own, to break the ice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How do you get on with your Blackberry?&rdquo; said I.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was not that I cared or had the business on the back of my mind; I was
      too much buried in my campaign for that; but Blackberry, with young Van
      Flange, was the one natural topic to propose.
    </p>
    <p>
      As I gave him the name of it, he started with the sudden nervousness of a
      cat. I caught the hissing intake of his breath, as though a knife pierced
      him. What was wrong? I had not looked at the reported quotations, such
      things being as Greek to me. Had he lost those millions? I could have
      borne it if he had; the better, perhaps, since I was sure in my soul that
      within two days I would have the town in hand, and I did not think to find
      my old paths so overgrown but what I'd make shift to pick my way to a
      second fortune.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was on the hinge of saying so, when he got possession of himself. Even
      at that he spoke lamely, and with a tongue that fumbled for words.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Blackberry!&rdquo; cried he. Then, after a gulping pause: &ldquo;That twist will
      work through all right. It has gone a trifle slow, because, by incredible
      exertions, the road did pay its dividends. But it's no more than a matter
      of weeks when it will come tumbling.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This, in the beginning, was rambled off with stops and halts, but in the
      wind-up it went glibly enough.
    </p>
    <p>
      What next I would have said, I cannot tell; nothing of moment, one may be
      sure, for my mind was running on other things than Blackberry up or down.
      It was at this point, however, when we were interrupted. A message arrived
      that asked my presence at headquarters.
    </p>
    <p>
      As I was about to depart, Blossom came into the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      I had no more than time for a hurried kiss, for the need set forth in the
      note pulled at me like horses.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bar accidents,&rdquo; said I, as I stood in the door, &ldquo;tomorrow night we'll
      celebrate a victory.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Within a block of my gate, I recalled how I had left certain papers I
      required lying on the table. I went back in some hustle of speed, for time
      was pinching as to that question of political detail which tugged for
      attention.
    </p>
    <p>
      As I stepped into the hallway, I caught the tone of young Van Flange and
      did not like the pitch of it. Blossom and he were in the room to the left,
      and only a door between us.
    </p>
    <p>
      In a strange bristle of temper, I stood still to hear. Would the scoundrel
      dare harshness with my girl? The very surmise turned me savage to the
      bone!
    </p>
    <p>
      Young Van Flange was speaking of those two hundred thousand dollars in
      bonds with which, by word of Big Kennedy, I had endowed Blossom in a day
      of babyhood. When she could understand, I had laid it solemnly upon her
      never to part with them. Under any stress, they would insure her against
      want; they must never be given up. And Blossom had promised.
    </p>
    <p>
      These bonds were in a steel casket of their own, and Blossom had the key.
      As I listened, young Van Flange was demanding they be given to him;
      Blossom was pleading with him, and quoting my commands. My girl was
      sobbing, too, for the villain urged the business roughly. I could not fit
      my ear to every word, since their tones for the most were dulled to a
      murmur by the door. In the end, with a lift of the voice, I heard him say:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For what else should I marry you except money? Is one of my blood to link
      himself with the daughter of the town's great thief, and call it love? The
      daughter of a murderer, too!&rdquo; he exclaimed, and ripping out an oath. &ldquo;A
      murderer, yes! You have the red proof about your throat! Because your
      father escaped hanging by the laws of men, heaven's law is hanging you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As I threw wide the door, Blossom staggered and fell to the floor. I
      thought for the furious blink of the moment, that he had struck her. How
      much stronger is hate than love! My dominant impulse was to avenge Blossom
      rather than to save her. I stood in the door in a white flame of wrath
      that was like the utter anger of a tiger. I saw him bleach and shrink
      beneath his sallowness.
    </p>
    <p>
      As I came towards him, he held up his hands after the way of a boxing
      school. That ferocious strength, like a gorilla's, still abode with me. I
      brushed away his guard as one might put aside a trailing vine. In a flash
      I had him, hip and shoulder. My fingers sunk into the flesh like things of
      steel; he squeaked and struggled as does the rabbit when crunched up by
      the hound.
    </p>
    <p>
      With a swing and a heave that would have torn out a tree by its roots, I
      lifted him from his feet. The next moment I hurled him from me. He crashed
      against the casing of the door; then he slipped to the floor as though
      struck by death itself.
    </p>
    <p>
      Moved of the one blunt purpose of destruction, I made forward to seize him
      again. For a miracle of luck, I was withstood by one of the servants who
      rushed in.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Think, master; think what you do!&rdquo; he cried.
    </p>
    <p>
      In a sort of whirl I looked about me. I could see how the old Galway nurse
      was bending over Blossom, crying on her for her &ldquo;Heart's dearie!&rdquo; My poor
      girl was lying along the rug like some tempest-broken flower. The stout
      old wife caught her up and bore her off in her arms.
    </p>
    <p>
      The picture of my girl's white face set me ablaze again. I turned the very
      torch of rage!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Be wise, master!&rdquo; cried that one who had restrained me before. &ldquo;Think of
      what you do!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The man's hand on my wrist, and the earnest voice of him, brought me to
      myself. A vast calm took me, as a storm in its double fury beats flat the
      surface of the sea. I turned my back and walked to the window.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have him away, then!&rdquo; cried I. &ldquo;Have him out of my sight, or I'll tear
      him to rags and ribbons where he lies!&rdquo;

      CHAPTER XXVI&mdash;THE VICTOR AND THE SPOILS
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">F</span>OR all the cry and
      call of politics, and folk to see me whom I would not see, that night, and
      throughout the following day&mdash;and even though the latter were one of
      election Fate to decide for the town's mastery&mdash;I never stirred from
      Blossom's side. She, poor child! was as one desolate, dazed with the blow
      that had been dealt her. She lay on her pillow, silent, and with the
      stricken face that told of the heart-blight fallen upon her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nor was I in much more enviable case, although gifted of a rougher
      strength to meet the shock. Indeed, I was taught by a despair that preyed
      upon me, how young Van Flange had grown to be the keystone of my arch of
      single hope, now fallen to the ground. Blossom's happiness had been my
      happiness, and when her breast was pierced, my own brightness of life
      began to bleed away. Darkness took me in the folds of it as in a shroud; I
      would have found the grave kinder, but I must remain to be what prop and
      stay I might to Blossom.
    </p>
    <p>
      While I sat by my girl's bed, there was all the time a peril that kept
      plucking at my sleeve in a way of warning. My nature is of an inveterate
      kind that, once afire and set to angry burning, goes on and on in ever
      increasing flames like a creature of tow, and with me helpless to smother
      or so much as half subdue the conflagration. I was so aware of myself in
      that dangerous behalf that it would press upon me as a conviction, even
      while I held my girl's hand and looked into her vacant eye, robbed of a
      last ray of any peace to come, that young Van Flange must never stray
      within my grasp. It would bring down his destruction; it would mean red
      hands for me and nothing short of murder. And, so, while I waited by
      Blossom's side, and to blot out the black chance of it, I sent word for
      Inspector McCue.
    </p>
    <p>
      The servants, on that day of awful misery, conveyed young Van Flange from
      the room. When he had been revived, and his injuries dressed&mdash;for his
      head bled from a gash made by the door, and his shoulder had been
      dislocated&mdash;he was carried from the house by the brougham that
      brought him, and which still waited at the gate. No one about me owned
      word of his whereabouts. It was required that he be found, not more for
      his sake than my own, and his destinies disposed of beyond my reach.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was to this task I would set Inspector McCue. For once in a way, my
      call was for an honest officer. I would have Inspector McCue discover
      young Van Flange, and caution him out of town. I cared not where he went,
      so that he traveled beyond the touch of my fingers, already itching for
      the caitiff neck of him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nor did I think young Van Flange would resist the advice of Inspector
      McCue. He had reasons for flight other than those I would furnish. The
      very papers, shouted in the streets to tell how I had re-taken the town at
      the polls, told also of the failure of the brokerage house of Van Flange;
      and that young Van Flange, himself, was a defaulter and his arrest being
      sought by clients on a charge of embezzling the funds which had been
      intrusted to his charge. The man was a fugitive from justice; he lay
      within the menace of a prison; he would make no demur now when word and
      money were given him to take himself away.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Inspector McCue arrived, I greeted him with face of granite. He
      should have no hint of my agony. I went bluntly to the core of the employ;
      to dwell upon the business would be nothing friendly to my taste.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know young Van Flange?&rdquo; Inspector McCue gave a nod of assent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you can locate him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The proposition is so easy it's a pushover.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Find him, then, and send him out of the town; and for a reason, should he
      ask one, you may say that I shall slay him should we meet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Inspector McCue looked at me curiously. He elevated his brow, but in the
      end he said nothing, whether of inquiry or remark. Without a reply he took
      himself away. My face, at the kindliest, was never one to speak of
      confidences or invite a question, and I may suppose the expression of it,
      as I dealt with Inspector McCue, to have been more than commonly
      repellent.
    </p>
    <p>
      There abode another with whom I wanted word; that one was Morton; for hard
      by forty years he had not once failed me in a strait. I would ask him the
      story of those Blackberry stocks. A glance into my steel box had showed me
      the bottom as bare as winter boughs. The last scrap was gone; and no more
      than the house that covered us, and those two hundred thousand dollars in
      bonds that were Blossom's, to be left of all our fortune.
    </p>
    <p>
      My temper was not one to mourn for any loss of money; and yet in this
      instance I would have those steps that led to my destruction set forth to
      me. If it were the president of Blackberry Traction who had taken my
      money, I meditated reprisal. Not that I fell into any heat of hatred
      against him; he but did to me what Morton and I a few years further back
      had portioned out to him. For all that, I was coldly resolved to have my
      own again. I intended no stock shifts; I would not seek Wall Street for my
      revenge. I knew a sharper method and a surer. It might glisten less with
      elegance, but it would prove more secure. But first, I would have the word
      of Morton.
    </p>
    <p>
      That glass of exquisite fashion and mold of proper form, albeit something
      grizzled, and like myself a trifle dimmed of time, tendered his
      congratulations upon my re-conquest of the town. I drew him straight to my
      affair of Blackberry.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Really, old chap,&rdquo; said Morton, the while plaintively disapproving of me
      through those eyeglasses, so official in his case, &ldquo;really, old chap, you
      walked into a trap, and one a child should have seen. That Blackberry
      fellow had the market rigged, don't y' know. I could have saved you, but,
      my boy, I didn't dare. You've such a beastly temper when anyone saves you.
      Besides, it isn't good form to wander into the stock deals of a gentleman,
      and begin to tell him what he's about; it isn't, really.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But what did this Blackberry individual do?&rdquo; I persisted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, he let you into a corner, don't y' know! He had been quietly buying
      Blackberry for months. He had the whole stock of the road in his safe; and
      you, in the most innocent way imaginable, sold thousands of shares. Now
      when you sell a stock, you must buy; you must, really! And there was no
      one from whom to buy save our sagacious friend. Gad! as the business
      stood, old chap, he might have had the coat off your back!&rdquo; And Morton
      glared in horror over the disgrace of the situation.
    </p>
    <p>
      While I took no more than a glimmer of Morton's meaning, two things were
      made clear. The Blackberry president had stripped me of my millions; and
      he had laid a snare to get them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Was young Van Flange in the intrigue?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not in the beginning, at least. There was no need, don't y' know. His
      hand was already into your money up to the elbow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you intend by saying that young Van Flange was not in the affair
      in the beginning?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The fact is, old chap, one or two things occurred that led me to think
      that young Van Flange discovered the trap after he'd sold some eight or
      ten thousand shares. There was a halt, don't y' know, in his operations.
      Then later he went on and sold you into bankruptcy. I took it from young
      Van Flange's manner that the Blackberry fellow might have had some secret
      hold upon him, and either threatened him, or promised him, or perhaps
      both, to get him to go forward with his sales; I did, really. Young Van
      Flange didn't, in the last of it, conduct himself like a free moral or, I
      should say, immoral agent.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can't account for it,&rdquo; said I, falling into thought; &ldquo;I cannot see how
      young Van Flange could have been betrayed into the folly you describe.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why then,&rdquo; said Morton, a bit wearily, &ldquo;I have but to say over what
      you've heard from me before. Young Van Flange was in no sort that man of
      gifts you held him to be; now really, he wasn't, don't y' know! Anyone
      might have hoodwinked him. Besides, he didn't keep up with the markets.
      While I think it beastly bad form to go talking against a chap when he's
      absent, the truth is, the weak-faced beggar went much more to Barclay than
      to Wall Street. However, that is only hearsay; I didn't follow young Van
      Flange to Barclay Street nor meet him across a faro layout by way of
      verification.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Morton was right; and I was to hear a worse tale, and that from Inspector
      McCue.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Would have been here before,&rdquo; said Inspector McCue when he came to
      report, &ldquo;but I wanted to see our party aboard ship, and outside Sandy Hook
      light, so that I might report the job cleaned up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then clearing his throat, and stating everything in the present tense,
      after the police manner, Inspector McCue went on.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When you ask me can I locate our party, I says to myself, 'Sure thing!'
      and I'll put you on to why. Our party is a dope fiend; it's a horse to a
      hen at that very time he can be turned up in some Chink joint.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Opium?&rdquo; I asked in astonishment. I had never harbored the thought.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, sure! That's the reason he shows so sallow about the gills, and with
      eyes like holes burnt in a blanket. When he lets up on the bottle, he
      shifts to hop.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go on,&rdquo; said I.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now,&rdquo; continued Inspector McCue, &ldquo;I thought I knew the joint in which to
      find our party. One evenin', three or four years ago, when the Reverend
      Bronson and I are lookin' up those Barclay Street crooks, I see our party
      steerin' into Mott Street. I goes after him, and comes upon him in a joint
      where he's hittin' the pipe. The munk who runs it has just brought him a
      layout, and is cookin' the pill for him when I shoves in.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now when our party is in present trouble, I puts it to myself, that he's
      sure to be goin' against the pipe. It would be his idea of gettin'
      cheerful, see! So I chases for the Mott Street hang-out, and there's our
      party sure enough, laid out on a mat, and a roll of cotton batting under
      his head for a pillow. He's in the skies, so my plan for a talk right then
      is all off. The air of the place is that thick with hop it would have
      turned the point of a knife, but I stays and plays my string out until he
      can listen and talk.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When our party's head is again on halfway straight, and he isn't such a
      dizzy Willie, I puts it to him that he'd better do a skulk.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'You're wanted,' says I, 'an' as near as I make the size-up, you'll take
      about five spaces if you're brought to trial. You'd better chase; and by
      way of the Horn, at that. If you go cross-lots, you might get the collar
      on a hot wire from headquarters, and be taken off the train. Our party
      nearly throws a faint when I says 'embezzlement.' It's the first tip he'd
      had, for I don't think he's been made wise to so much as a word since he
      leaves here. It put the scare into him for fair; he was ready to do
      anything I say.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Only,' says he, 'I don't know what money I've got. And I'm too dippy to
      find out.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;With that, I go through him. It's in his trousers pocket I springs a
      plant&mdash;fifteen hundred dollars, about.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Here's dough enough and over,' says I; and in six hours after, he's
      aboard ship.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She don't get her lines off until this morning, though; but I stays by,
      for I'm out to see him safe beyond the Hook.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What more do you know of young Van Flange?&rdquo; I asked. &ldquo;Did you learn
      anything about his business habits?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;From the time you start him with those offices in Broad Street, our
      party's business habits are hop and faro bank. The offices are there; the
      clerks and the blackboards and the stock tickers and the tape baskets are
      there; but our party, more'n to butt in about three times a week and leave
      some crazy orders to sell Blackberry Traction, is never there. He's either
      in Mott Street, and a Chink cookin' hop for him; or he's in Barclay Street
      with those Indians, and they handin' him out every sort of brace from an
      'end-squeeze' or a 'balance-top,' where they give him two cards at a
      clatter, to a 'snake' box, where they kindly lets him deal, but do him
      just the same. Our party lose over a half-million in that Barclay Street
      deadfall during the past Year.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I must, then,&rdquo; said I, and I felt the irony of it, &ldquo;have been indirectly
      contributing to the riches of our friend, the Chief of Police, since you
      once told me he was a principal owner of the Barclay Street place.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Inspector McCue shrugged his shoulders professionally, and made no
      response. Then I questioned him as to the charge of embezzlement; for I
      had not owned the heart to read the story in the press.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's that Blackberry push,&rdquo; replied Inspector McCue, &ldquo;and I don't think
      it's on the level at that. It looks like the Blackberry president&mdash;and,
      by the way, I've talked with the duffer, and took in all he would tell&mdash;made
      a play to get the drop on our party. And although the trick was put up, I
      think he landed it. He charges now that our party is a welcher, and gets
      away with a bunch of bonds&mdash;hocked 'em or something like that&mdash;which
      this Blackberry guy gives him to stick in as margins on some deal. As I
      say, I think it's a put-up job. That Blackberry duck&mdash;who is quite a
      flossy form of stock student and a long shot from a slouch&mdash;has some
      game up his sleeve. He wanted things rigged so's he could put the clamps
      on our party, and make him do as he says, and pinch him whenever it gets
      to be a case of must. So he finally gets our party where he can't holler.
      I makes a move to find out the inside story; but the Blackberry sport is a
      thought too swift, and he won't fall to my game. I gives it to him dead
      that he braced our party, and asks him, Why? At that he hands me the
      frozen face, springs a chest, and says he's insulted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But the end of it is this: Our party is now headed for Frisco. When he
      comes ashore, the cops out there will pick him up and keep a tab on him;
      we can always touch the wire for his story down to date. Whenever you say
      the word, I can get a line on him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bring me no tales of him!&rdquo; I cried. &ldquo;I would free myself of every memory
      of the scoundrel!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      That, then, was the story&mdash;a story of gambling and opium! It was
      these that must account for the sallow face, stooped shoulders, hollow
      eyes, and nights away from home. And the man of Blackberry, from whom
      Morton and I took millions, had found in the situation his opportunity. He
      laid his plans and had those millions back. Also, it was I, as it had been
      others, to now suffer by Barclay Street.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And now,&rdquo; observed Inspector McCue, his hand on the door, but turning
      with a look at once inquisitive and wistful&mdash;the latter, like the
      anxious manner of a good dog who asks word to go upon his hunting&mdash;&ldquo;and
      now, I suppose, you'll be willin' to let me pull that outfit in Barclay
      Street. I've got 'em dead to rights!&rdquo; The last hopefully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If it be a question,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;of where a man shall lose His money, for
      my own part, I have no preference as to whether he is robbed in Barclay
      Street or robbed in Wall. We shall let the Barclay Street den alone, if
      you please. The organization has its alliances. These alliances cannot be
      disturbed without weakening the organization. I would not make the order
      when it was prayed for by the mother of young Van Flange, and she died
      with the prayer on her lips. I shall not make it now when it is I who am
      the sufferer. It must be Tammany before all; on no slighter terms can
      Tammany be preserved.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Inspector McCue made no return to this, and went his way in silence. It
      was a change, however, from that other hour when I had been with him as
      cold and secret as a vault. He felt the flattery of my present confidence,
      and it colored him with complacency as he took his leave.
    </p>
    <p>
      Roundly, it would be two months after the election before Tammany took
      charge of the town. The eight weeks to intervene I put in over that list
      of officers to be named by me through the mayor and the various chiefs of
      the departments. These places&mdash;and they were by no means a stinted
      letter, being well-nigh thirty thousand&mdash;must be apportioned among
      the districts, each leader having his just share.
    </p>
    <p>
      While I wrought at these details of patronage, setting a man's name to a
      place, and all with fine nicety of discrimination to prevent jealousies
      and a thought that this or that one of my wardogs had been wronged, a plan
      was perfecting itself in my mind. The thought of Blossom was ever
      uppermost. What should I do to save the remainder of her life in peace? If
      she were not to be wholly happy, still I would buckler her as far as lay
      with me against the more aggressive darts of grief. There is such a word
      as placid, and, though one be fated to dwell with lasting sorrow, one
      would prefer it as the mark of one's condition to others of tumultuous
      violence. There lies a choice, and one will make it, even among torments.
      How could I conquer serenity for Blossom?&mdash;how should I go about it
      to invest what further years were hers with the restful blessings of
      peace? That was now the problem of my life, and at last I thought it
      solved.
    </p>
    <p>
      My decision was made to deal with the town throughout the next regime as
      with a gold mine. I would work it night and day, sparing neither
      conscience nor sleep; I would have from it what utmost bulk of treasure I
      might during the coming administration of the town's affairs. The game lay
      in my palm; I would think on myself and nothing but myself; justice and
      right were to be cast aside; the sufferings of others should be no more to
      me than mine had been to them. I would squeeze the situation like a
      sponge, and for its last drop. Then laying down my guiding staff as Chief,
      I would carry Blossom, and those riches I had heaped together, to regions,
      far away and new, where only the arch of gentle skies should bend above
      her days! She should have tranquillity! she should find rest! That was my
      plan, my hope; I kept it buried in my breast, breathed of it to no man,
      not even the kindly Morton, and set myself with all of that ferocious
      industry which was so much the badge of my nature to its carrying forth.
      Four years; and then, with the gold of a Monte Cristo, I would take
      Blossom and go seeking that repose which I believed must surely wait for
      us somewhere beneath the sun!
    </p>
    <p>
      While I was engaged about those preliminaries demanded of me if the
      machine were to begin its four-years' reign on even terms of comfort,
      Morton was often at my shoulder with a point or a suggestion. I was glad
      to have him with me; for his advice in a fog of difficulty such as mine,
      was what chart and lighthouse are to mariners.
    </p>
    <p>
      One afternoon while Morton and I were trying to hit upon some man of
      education to take second place and supplement the ignorance of one whom
      the equities of politics appointed to be the head of a rich but difficult
      department, the Reverend Bronson came in.
    </p>
    <p>
      We three&mdash;the Reverend Bronson, Morton, and myself&mdash;were older
      now than on days we could remember, and each showed the sere and yellow of
      his years. But we liked each other well; and, although in no sort similar
      in either purpose or bent, I think time had made us nearer friends than
      might have chanced with many who were more alike.
    </p>
    <p>
      On this occasion, while I engaged myself with lists of names and lists of
      offices, weighing out the spoils, Morton and the Reverend Bronson debated
      the last campaign, and what in its conclusion it offered for the future.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall try to be the optimist,&rdquo; said the Reverend Bronson at last,
      tossing up a brave manner. &ldquo;Since the dying administration was not so good
      as I hoped for, I trust the one to be born will not be so bad as I fear.
      And, as I gather light by experience, I begin to blame officials less and
      the public more. I suspect how a whole people may play the hypocrite as
      much as any single man; nor am I sure that, for all its clamors, a New
      York public really desires those white conditions of purity over which it
      protests so much.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Really!&rdquo; returned Morton, who had furnished ear of double interest to the
      Reverend Bronson's words, &ldquo;it is an error, don't y' know, to give any
      people a rule they don't desire. A government should always match a
      public. What do you suppose would become of them if one were to suddenly
      organize a negro tribe of darkest Africa into a republic? Why, under such
      loose rule as ours, the poor savage beggars would gnaw each other like
      dogs&mdash;they would, really! It would be as depressing a solecism as a
      Scotchman among the stained glasses, the frescoes, and the Madonnas of a
      Spanish cathedral; or a Don worshiping within the four bare walls and roof
      of a Highland kirk. Whatever New York may pretend, it will always be found
      in possession of that sort of government, whether for virtue or for vice,
      whereof it secretly approves.&rdquo; And Morton surveyed the good dominie
      through that historic eyeglass as though pleased with what he'd said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But is it not humiliating?&rdquo; asked the Reverend Bronson. &ldquo;If what you say
      be true, does it not make for your discouragement?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No more than does the vulgar fact of dogs and horses, don't y' know!
      Really, I take life as it is, and think only to be amused. I remark on
      men, and upon their conditions of the moral, the mental, and the physical!&mdash;on
      the indomitable courage of restoration as against the ceaseless industry
      of decay!&mdash;on the high and the low, the good and the bad, the weak
      and the strong, the right and the wrong, the top and the bottom, the past
      and the future, the white and the black, and all those other things that
      are not!&mdash;and I laugh at all. There is but one thing real, one thing
      true, one thing important, one thing at which I never laugh!&mdash;and
      that is the present. But really!&rdquo; concluded Morton, recurring to
      affectations which for the moment had been forgot, &ldquo;I'm never discouraged,
      don't y' know! I shall never permit myself an interest deep enough for
      that; it wouldn't be good form. Even those beastly low standards which
      obtain, as you say, in New York do not discourage me. No, I'm never
      discouraged&mdash;really!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You do as much as any, by your indifference, to perpetuate those
      standards,&rdquo; remarked the Reverend Bronson in a way of mournful severity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear old chap,&rdquo; returned Morton, growing sprightly as the other
      displayed solemnity, &ldquo;I take, as I tell you, conditions as I find them,
      don't y' know! And wherefore no? It's all nature: it's the hog to its
      wallow, the eagle to its crag;&mdash;it is, really! Now an eagle in a
      mud-wallow, or a hog perching on a crag, would be deuced bad form! You see
      that yourself, you must&mdash;really!&rdquo; and our philosopher glowered
      sweetly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall never know,&rdquo; said the Reverend Bronson, with a half-laugh, &ldquo;when
      to have you seriously. I cannot but wish, however, that the town had
      better luck about its City Hall.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Really, I don't know, don't y' know!&rdquo; This deep observation Morton
      flourished off in a profound muse. &ldquo;As I've said, the town will get what's
      coming to it, because it will always get what it wants. It always has&mdash;really!
      And speaking of 'reform' as we employ the term in politics: The town, in
      honesty, never desires it; and that's why somebody must forever attend on
      'reform' to keep it from falling on its blundering nose and knees by
      holding it up by the tail. There are people who'll take anything you give
      them, even though it be a coat of tar and feathers, and thank you for it,
      too,&mdash;the grateful beggars! New York resembles these. Some chap comes
      along, and offers New York 'reform.' Being without 'reform' at the time,
      and made suddenly and sorrowfully mindful of its condition, it accepts the
      gift just as a drunkard takes a pledge. Like the drunkard, however, New
      York is apt to return to its old ways&mdash;it is, really!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One thing,&rdquo; said the Reverend Bronson as he arose to go, and laying his
      hand on my shoulder, &ldquo;since the Boss of Tammany, in a day of the machine,
      is the whole government and the source of it, I mean to come here often
      and work upon our friend in favor of a clean town.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you will be welcome, Doctor, let me say!&rdquo; I returned.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now I think,&rdquo; said Morton meditatively, when the Reverend Bronson had
      departed, &ldquo;precisely as I told our excellent friend. A rule should ever
      fit a people; and it ever does. A king is as naturally the blossom of the
      peasantry he grows on as is a sunflower natural to that coarse stem that
      supports its royal nod-dings, don't y' know. A tyranny, a despotism, a
      monarchy, or a republic is ever that flower of government natural to the
      public upon which it grows. Really!&mdash;Why not? Wherein lurks the
      injustice or the inconsistency of such a theory? What good is there to lie
      hidden in a misfit? Should Providence waste a man's government on a
      community of dogs? A dog public should have dog government:&mdash;a kick
      and a kennel, a chain to clank and a bone to gnaw!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With this last fragment of wisdom, the cynical Morton went also his way,
      leaving me alone to chop up the town&mdash;as a hunter chops up the
      carcass of a deer among his hounds&mdash;into steak and collop to feed my
      hungry followers.
    </p>
    <p>
      However much politics might engage me, I still possessed those hundred
      eyes of Argus wherewith to watch my girl. When again about me she had no
      word for what was past. And on my side, never once did I put to her the
      name of young Van Flange. He was as much unmentioned by us as though he
      had not been. I think that this was the wiser course. What might either
      Blossom or I have said to mend our shattered hopes?
    </p>
    <p>
      Still, I went not without some favor of events. There came a support to my
      courage; the more welcome, since the latter was often at its ebb. It was a
      strangest thing at that! While Blossom moved with leaden step, and would
      have impressed herself upon one as weak and wanting sparkle, she none the
      less began to gather the color of health. Her cheeks, before of the pallor
      of snow, wore a flush like the promise of life. Her face gained rounder
      fullness, while her eyes opened upon one with a kind of wide brilliancy,
      that gave a look of gayety. It was like a blessing! Nor could I forbear,
      as I witnessed it, the dream of a better strength for my girl than it had
      been her luck to know; and that thought would set me to my task of
      money-getting with ever a quicker ardor.
    </p>
    <p>
      Still, as I've said, there was the side to baffle. For all those roses and
      eyes like stars, Blossom's breath was broken and short, and a little trip
      upstairs or down exhausted her to the verge of pain. To mend her breathing
      after one of these small household expeditions, she must find a chair, or
      even lie on a couch. All this in its turn would have set my fears to a
      runaway if it had not been for that fine glow in her cheeks to each time
      restore me to my faith.
    </p>
    <p>
      When I put the question born of my uneasiness, Blossom declared herself
      quite well, nor would she give me any sicklier word. In the end my fears
      would go back to their slumbers, and I again bend myself wholly to that
      task of gold.
    </p>
    <p>
      Good or bad, to do this was when all was said the part of complete wisdom.
      There could be nothing now save my plan of millions and a final pilgrimage
      in quest of peace. That was our single chance; and at it, in a kind of
      savage silence, night and day I stormed as though warring with walls and
      battlements.

      CHAPTER XXVII&mdash;GOLD CAME, AND DEATH STEPPED IN
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">N</span>OW, when I went
      about refurnishing my steel box with new millions, I turned cautious as a
      fox. I considered concealment, and would hide my trail and walk in all the
      running water that I might. For one matter, I was sick and sore with the
      attacks made upon me by the papers, which grew in malignant violence as
      the days wore on, and as though it were a point of rivalry between them
      which should have the black honor of hating me the most. I preferred to
      court those type-cudgelings as little as stood possible, and still bring
      me to my ends.
    </p>
    <p>
      The better to cover myself, and because the mere work of it would be too
      weary a charge for one head and that head ignorant of figures, I called
      into my service a cunning trio who were, one and all, born children of the
      machine. These three owned thorough training as husbandmen of politics,
      and were ones to mow even the fence corners. That profit of the game which
      escaped them must indeed be sly, and lie deep and close besides. Also,
      they were of the invaluable brood that has no tongue, and any one of the
      triangle would have been broken upon the wheel without a syllable of
      confession disgracing his lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      These inveterate ones, who would be now as my hand in gathering together
      that wealth which I anticipated, were known in circles wherein they moved
      and had their dingy being, as Sing Sing Jacob, Puffy the Merchant, and
      Paddy the Priest. Paddy the Priest wore a look of sanctity, and it was
      this impression of holiness to confer upon him his title. It might have
      been more consistent with those virtues of rapine dominant of his nature,
      had he been hailed Paddy the Pirate, instead. Of Sing Sing Jacob, I should
      say, that he had not served in prison. His name was given him because,
      while he was never granted the privilege of stripes and irons, he often
      earned the same. In what manner or at what font Puffy the Merchant
      received baptism, I never learned. That he came fit for my purpose would
      find sufficient indication in a complaining compliment which Paddy the
      Priest once paid him, and who said in description of Puffy's devious
      genius, that if one were to drive a nail through his head it would come
      forth a corkscrew.
    </p>
    <p>
      These men were to be my personal lieutenants, and collect my gold for me.
      And since they would pillage me with as scanty a scruple as though I were
      the foe himself, I must hit upon a device for invoking them to honesty in
      ny affairs. It was then I remembered the parting words of Big Kennedy. I
      would set one against the others; hating each other, they would watch; and
      each would be sharp with warning in my ear should either of his fellows
      seek to fill a purse at my expense.
    </p>
    <p>
      To sow discord among my three offered no difficulties; I had but to say to
      one what the others told of him, and his ire was on permanent end. It was
      thus I separated them; and since I gave each his special domain of effort,
      while they worked near enough to one another to maintain a watch, they
      were not so thrown together as to bring down among them open war.
    </p>
    <p>
      It will be required that I set forth in half-detail those various
      municipal fields and meadows that I laid out in my time, and from which
      the machine was to garner its harvest. You will note then, you who are
      innocent of politics in its practical expressions and rewards, how the
      town stood to me as does his plowlands to a farmer, and offered as various
      a list of crops to careful tillage. Take for example the knee-deep clover
      of the tax department. Each year there was made a whole valuation of
      personal property of say roundly nine billions of dollars. This estimate,
      within a dozen weeks of its making, would be reduced to fewer than one
      billion, on the word of individuals who made the law-required oaths. No,
      it need not have been so reduced; but the reduction ever occurred since
      the machine instructed its tax officers to act on the oath so furnished,
      and that without question.
    </p>
    <p>
      That personage in tax peril was never put to fret in obtaining one to make
      the oath. If he himself lacked hardihood and hesitated at perjury, why
      then, the town abounded in folk of a daring easy veracity. Of all that was
      said and written, of that time, in any New York day, full ninety-five per
      cent, was falsehood or mistake. Among the members of a community, so
      affluent of error and mendacity, one would not long go seeking a witness
      who was ready, for shining reasons, to take whatever oath might be
      demanded. And thus it befell that the affidavits were ever made, and a
      reduction of eight billions and more, in the assessed valuation of
      personal property, came annually to be awarded. With a tax levy of, say,
      two per cent. I leave you to fix the total of those millions saved to ones
      assessed, and also to consider how far their gratitude might be expected
      to inure to the yellow welfare of the machine&mdash;the machine that makes
      no gift of either its forbearance or its help!
    </p>
    <p>
      Speaking in particular of the town, and what opportunities of riches swung
      open to the machine, one should know at the start how the whole annual
      expense of the community was roughly one hundred and twenty-five millions.
      Of these millions twenty went for salaries to officials; forty were
      devoted to the purchase of supplies asked for by the public needs; while
      the balance, sixty-five millions, represented contracts for paving and
      building and similar construction whatnot, which the town was bound to
      execute in its affairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      Against those twenty millions of salaries, the machine levied an annual
      private five per cent. Two-thirds of the million to arise therefrom, found
      their direct way to district leaders; the other one-third was paid into
      the general coffer. Also there were county officers, such as judges,
      clerks of court, a sheriff and his deputies: and these, likewise, were
      compelled from their incomes to a yearly generosity of not fewer than five
      per cent.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of those forty millions which were the measure for supplies, one-fifth
      under the guise of &ldquo;commissions&rdquo; went to the machine; while of the
      sixty-five millions, which represented the yearly contracts in payments
      made thereon, the machine came better off with, at the leanest of
      estimates, full forty per cent, of the whole.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now I have set forth to you those direct returns which arose from the sure
      and fixed expenses of the town. Beyond that, and pushing for the furthest
      ounce of tallow, I inaugurated a novelty. I organized a guaranty company
      which made what bonds the law demanded from officials; and from men with
      contracts, and those others who furnished the town's supplies. The annual
      charge of the company for this act of warranty was two per cent, on the
      sum guaranteed; and since the aggregate thus carried came to about one
      hundred millions, the intake from such sources&mdash;being for the most
      part profit in the fingers of the machine&mdash;was annually a fair two
      millions. There were other rills to flow a revenue, and which were related
      to those money well-springs registered above, but they count too many and
      too small for mention here, albeit the round returns from them might make
      a poor man stare.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of those other bottom-lands of profit which bent a nodding harvest to the
      sickle of the machine, let me make a rough enumeration. The returns&mdash;a
      bit sordid, these!&mdash;from poolrooms, faro banks and disorderly resorts
      and whereon the monthly charge imposed for each ran all the way from fifty
      to two thousand dollars, clinked into the yearly till, four millions. The
      grog shops, whereof at that time there was a staggering host of such in
      New York City of-the-many-sins! met each a draft of twenty monthly
      dollars. Then one should count &ldquo;campaign contributions.&rdquo; Of great
      companies who sued for favor there were, at a lowest census, five who sent
      as tribute from twenty to fifty thousand dollars each. Also there existed
      of smaller concerns and private persons, full one thousand who yielded
      over all a no less sum than one million. Next came the police, with
      appointment charges which began with a patrolman at four hundred dollars,
      and soared to twenty thousand when the matter was the making of a captain.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here I shall close my recapitulation of former treasure for the machine; I
      am driven to warn you, however, that the half has not been told. Still, if
      you will but let your imagination have its head, remembering how the
      machine gives nothing away, and fails not to exert its pressures with
      every chance afforded it, you may supply what other chapters belong with
      the great history of graft.
    </p>
    <p>
      When one considers a Tammany profit, one will perforce be driven to the
      question: What be the expenses of the machine? The common cost of an
      election should pause in the neighborhood of three hundred thousand
      dollars. Should peril crowd, and an imported vote be called for by the
      dangers of the day, the cost might carry vastly higher. No campaign,
      however, in the very nature of the enterprise and its possibilities of
      expense, can consume a greater fund than eight hundred thousand. That sum,
      subtracted from the income of the machine as taken from those sundry
      sources I've related, will show what in my time remained for distribution
      among my followers.
    </p>
    <p>
      And now that brings one abreast the subject of riches to the Boss himself.
      One of the world's humorists puts into the mouth of a character the query:
      What does a king get? The answer would be no whit less difficult had he
      asked: What does a Boss get? One may take it, however, that the latter
      gets the lion's share. Long ago I said that the wealth of Ophir hung on
      the hazard of the town's election. You have now some slant as to how far
      my words should be regarded as hyperbole. Nor must I omit how the
      machine's delegation in a legislature, or the little flock it sends to
      nibble on the slopes of Congress, is each in the hand of the Boss to do
      with as he will, and it may go without a record that the opportunities so
      provided are neither neglected nor underpriced.
    </p>
    <p>
      There you have the money story of Tammany in the bowels of the town. Those
      easy-chair economists who, over their morning coffee and waffles, engage
      themselves for purity, will at this point give honest rage the rein. Had I
      no sense of public duty? Was the last spark of any honesty burned out
      within my bosom? Was nothing left but dead embers to be a conscience to
      me? The Reverend Bronson&mdash;and I had a deep respect for that gentleman&mdash;put
      those questions in his time.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bear in mind,&rdquo; said he when, after that last election, I again had the
      town in my grasp, &ldquo;bear in mind the welfare and the wishes of the public,
      and use your power consistently therewith.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, why?&rdquo; said I. &ldquo;The public of which you tell me lies in two pieces,
      the minority and the majority. It is to the latter's welfare&mdash;the
      good of the machine&mdash;I shall address myself. Be sure, my acts will
      gain the plaudits of my own people, while I have only to go the road you
      speak of to be made the target of their anger. As to the minority&mdash;those
      who have vilified me, and who still would crush me if they but had the
      strength&mdash;why, then, as Morton says, I owe them no more than William
      owed the Saxons when after Hastings he had them under his feet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When the new administration was in easy swing, and I had time to look
      about me, I bethought me of Blackberry and those three millions taken from
      the weakness and the wickedness of young Van Flange. I would have those
      millions back or know the secret of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      With a nod here and a hand-toss there&mdash;for the shrug of my shoulders
      or the lift of my brows had grown to have a definition among my people&mdash;I
      brewed tempests for Blackberry. The park department discovered it in a
      trespass; the health board gave it notice of the nonsanitary condition of
      its cars; the street commissioner badgered it with processes because of
      violations of laws and ordinances; the coroner, who commonly wore a gag,
      gave daily news of what folk were killed or maimed through the wantonness
      of Blackberry; while my corporation counsel bestirred himself as to
      whether or no, for this neglect or that invasion of public right, the
      Blackberry charter might not be revoked.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the face of these, the president of Blackberry&mdash;he of the Hebrew
      cast and clutch&mdash;stood sullenly to his guns. He would not yield; he
      would not pay the price of peace; he would not return those millions,
      although he knew well the argument which was the ground-work of his
      griefs.
    </p>
    <p>
      The storm I unchained beat sorely, but he made no white-flag signs. I
      admired his fortitude, while I multiplied my war.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was Morton who pointed to that final feather which broke the camel's
      back.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Really, old chap,&rdquo; observed Morton, that immortal eyeglass on nose and
      languid hands outspread, &ldquo;really, you haven't played your trumps, don't y'
      know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What then?&rdquo; cried I, for my heart was growing hot.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You recall my saying to our friend Bronson that, when I had a chap
      against me whom I couldn't buy, I felt about to discover his fad or his
      fear&mdash;I was speaking about changing a beggar's name, and all that,
      don't y' know?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;it all comes back.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Exactly,&rdquo; continued Morton. &ldquo;Now the fear that keeps a street-railway
      company awake nights is its fear of a strike. There, my dear boy, you have
      your weapon. Convey the information to those Blackberry employees, that
      you think they get too little money and work too long a day. Let them
      understand how, should they strike, your police will not repress them in
      any crimes they see fit to commit. Really, I think I've hit upon a
      splendid idea! Those hirelings will go upon the warpath, don't y' know!
      And a strike is such a beastly thing!&mdash;such a deuced bore! It is,
      really!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Within the fortnight every Blackberry wheel was stopped, and every
      employee rioting in the streets. Cars were sacked; what men offered for
      work were harried, and made to fly for very skins and bones. Meanwhile,
      the police stood afar off with virgin-batons, innocent of interference.
    </p>
    <p>
      Four days of this, and those four millions were paid into my hand; the
      Blackberry president had yielded, and my triumph was complete. With that,
      my constabulary remembered law and order, and, descending upon the
      turbulent, calmed them with their clubs. The strike ended; again were the
      gongs of an unharassed Blackberry heard in the land.
    </p>
    <p>
      And now I draw near the sorrowful, desperate end&mdash;the end at once of
      my labors and my latest hope. I had held the town since the last battle
      for well-nigh three and one-half years. Throughout this space affairs
      political preserved themselves as rippleless as a looking-glass, and
      nothing to ruffle with an adverse wind. Those henchmen&mdash;my boys of
      the belt, as it were&mdash;Sing Sing Jacob, Puffy the Merchant, and Paddy
      the Priest, went working like good retrievers at their task of bringing
      daily money to my feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nor was I compelled to appear as one interested in the profits of the
      town's farming, and this of itself was comfort, since it served to keep me
      aloof from any mire of those methods that were employed.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is wonderful how a vile source for a dollar will in no wise daunt a
      man, so that he be not made to pick it from the direct mud himself. If but
      one hand intervene between his own and that gutter which gave it up, both
      his conscience and his sensibilities are satisfied to receive it. Of all
      sophists, self-interest is the sophist surest of disciples; it will carry
      conviction triumphant against what fact or what deduction may come to
      stand in the way, and, with the last of it, &ldquo;The smell of all money is
      sweet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But while it was isles of spice and summer seas with my politics, matters
      at home went ever darker with increasing threat. Blossom became weaker and
      still more weak, and wholly from a difficulty in her breathing. If she
      were to have had but her breath, her health would have been fair enough;
      and that I say by word of the physician who was there to attend her, and
      who was a gray deacon of his guild.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is her breathing,&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;otherwise her health is good for any call
      she might make upon it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was the more strange to one looking on; for all this time while Blossom
      was made to creep from one room to another, and, for the most part, to lie
      panting upon a couch, her cheeks were round and red as peaches, and her
      eyes grew in size and brightness like stars when the night is dark.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Would you have her sent away?&rdquo; I asked of the physician. &ldquo;Say but the
      place; I will take her there myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She is as well here,&rdquo; said he. Then, as his brows knotted with the
      problem of it: &ldquo;This is an unusual case; so unusual, indeed, that during
      forty years of practice I have never known its fellow. However, it is no
      question of climate, and she will be as well where she is. The better;
      since she has no breath with which to stand a journey.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      While I said nothing to this, I made up my mind to have done with politics
      and take Blossom away. It would, at the worst, mean escape from scenes
      where we had met with so much misery. That my present rule of the town
      owned still six months of life before another battle, did not move me. I
      would give up my leadership and retire at once. It would lose me half a
      year of gold-heaping, but what should that concern? What mattered a
      handful of riches, more or less, as against the shoreless relief of
      seclusion, and Blossom in new scenes of quiet peace? The very newness
      would take up her thoughts; and with nothing about to recall what had
      been, or to whisper the name of that villain who hurt her heart to the
      death, she might have even the good fortune to forget. My decision was
      made, and I went quietly forward to bring my politics to a close.
    </p>
    <p>
      It became no question of weeks nor even days; I convened my district
      leaders, and with the few words demanded of the time, returned them my
      chiefship and stepped down and out. Politics and I had parted; the machine
      and I were done.
    </p>
    <p>
      At that, I cannot think I saw regret over my going in any of the faces
      which stared up at me. There was a formal sorrow of words; but the great
      expression to to seize upon each was that of selfish eagerness. I, with my
      lion's share of whatever prey was taken, would be no more; it was the
      thought of each that with such the free condition he would be like to find
      some special fatness not before his own.
    </p>
    <p>
      Well! what else should I have looked for?&mdash;I, who had done only
      justice by them, why should I be loved? Let them exult; they have
      subserved my purpose and fulfilled my turn. I was retiring with the wealth
      of kings:&mdash;I, who am an ignorant man, and the son of an Irish smith!
      If my money had been put into gold it would have asked the strength of
      eighty teams, with a full ton of gold to a team, to have hauled it out of
      town&mdash;a solid procession of riches an easy half-mile in length! No
      Alexander, no Cæsar, no Napoleon in his swelling day of conquest, could
      have made the boast! I was master of every saffron inch of forty millions!
    </p>
    <p>
      That evening I sat by Blossom's couch and told her of my plans. I made but
      the poor picture of it, for I have meager power of words, and am fettered
      with an imagination of no wings. Still, she smiled up at me as though with
      pleasure&mdash;for her want of breath was so urgent she could not speak
      aloud, but only whisper a syllable now and then&mdash;and, after a while,
      I kissed her, and left her with the physician and nurse for the night.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was during the first hours of the morning when I awoke in a sweat of
      horror, as if something of masterful menace were in the room. With a chill
      in my blood like the touch of ice, I thought of Blossom; and with that I
      began to huddle on my clothes to go to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      The physician met me at Blossom's door. He held me back with a gentle hand
      on my breast.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't go in!&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      That hand, light as a woman's, withstood me like a wall. I drew back and
      sought a chair in the library&mdash;a chair of Blossom's, it was&mdash;and
      sat glooming into the darkness in a wonder of fear.
    </p>
    <p>
      What wits I possess have broad feet, and are not easily to be staggered.
      That night, however, they swayed and rocked like drunken men, under the
      pressure of some evil apprehension of I knew not what. I suppose now I
      feared death for Blossom, and that my thoughts lacked courage to look the
      surmise in the face.
    </p>
    <p>
      An hour went by, and I still in the darkened room. I wanted no lights. It
      was as though I were a fugitive, and sought in the simple darkness a
      refuge and a place wherein to hide myself. Death was in the house, robbing
      me of all I loved; I knew that, and yet I felt no stab of agony, but
      instead a fashion of dumb numbness like a paralysis.
    </p>
    <p>
      In a vague way, this lack of sharp sensation worked upon my amazement. I
      remember that, in explanation of it, I recalled one of Morton's tales
      about a traveler whom a lion seized as he sat at his campfire; and how,
      while the lion crunched him in his jaws and dragged him to a distance, he
      still had no feel of pain, but&mdash;as I had then&mdash;only a numbness
      and fog of nerves.
    </p>
    <p>
      While this went running in my head, I heard the rattle of someone at the
      street door, and was aware, I don't know how, that another physician had
      come. A moment later my ear overtook whisperings in the hall just beyond
      my own door.
    </p>
    <p>
      Moved of an instinct that might have prompted some threatened animal to
      spy out what danger overhung him, I went, cat-foot, to the door and
      listened. It was the two physicians in talk.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The girl is dead,&rdquo; I heard one say.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What malady?&rdquo; asked the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And there's the marvel of it!&rdquo; cries the first. &ldquo;No malady at all, as I'm
      a doctor! She died of suffocation. The case is without a parallel.
      Indubitably, it was that birthmark&mdash;that mark as of a rope upon her
      neck. Like the grip of destiny itself, the mark has been growing and
      tightening about her throat since ever she lay in her cradle, until now
      she dies of it. A most remarkable case! It is precisely as though she were
      hanged&mdash;the congested eye, the discolored face, the swollen tongue,
      aye! and about her throat, the very mark of the rope!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Blossom dead! my girl dead! Apple Cheek, Anne, Blossom, all gone, and I to
      be left alone! Alone! The word echoed in the hollows of my empty heart as
      in a cavern! There came a blur, and then a fearful whirling; that gorilla
      strength was as the strength of children; my slow knees began to cripple
      down! That was the last I can recall; I fell as if struck by a giant's
      mallet, and all was black.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXVIII&mdash;BEING THE EPILOGUE
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">W</span>HAT should there
      be more? My house stands upon a hill; waving, sighing trees are ranked
      about it, while to the eastward I have the shimmering stretches of the
      river beneath my feet. From a wooden seat between two beeches, I may see
      the fog-loom born of the dust and smoke of the city far away. At night,
      when clouds lie thick and low, the red reflection of the city's million
      lamps breaks on the sky as though a fire raged.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is upon my seat between the beeches that I spend my days. Men would
      call my life a stagnant one; I care not, since I find it peace. I have
      neither hopes nor fears nor pains nor joys; there come no exaltations, no
      depressions; within me is a serenity&mdash;a kind of silence like the
      heart of nature.
    </p>
    <p>
      At that I have no dimness; I roll and rock for hours on the dead swells of
      old days, while old faces and old scenes toss to and fro like seaweed with
      the tides of my memory. I am prey to no regrets, to no ambitions; my times
      own neither currents nor winds; I have outlived importance and the liking
      for it; and all those little noises that keep the world awake, I never
      hear.
    </p>
    <p>
      My Sicilian, with his earrings and his crimson headwear of silk, is with
      me; for he could not have lived had I left him in town, being no more able
      to help himself than a ship ashore. Here he is busy and happy over
      nothing. He has whittled for himself a trio of little boats, and he sails
      them on the pond at the lawn's foot. One of these he has named the
      Democrat, while the others are the Republican and the Mugwump. He sails
      them against each other; and I think that by some marine sleight he gives
      the Democrat the best of it, since it ever wins, which is not true of
      politics. My Sicilian has just limped up the hill with a story of how, in
      the last race, the Republican and the Mugwump ran into one another and
      capsized, while the Democrat finished bravely.
    </p>
    <p>
      Save for my Sicilian, and a flock of sable ravens that by their tameness
      and a confident self-sufficiency have made themselves part of the
      household, I pass the day between my beeches undisturbed. The ravens are
      grown so proud with safety that, when I am walking, they often hold the
      path against me, picking about for the grains my Sicilian scatters,
      keeping upon me the while a truculent eye that is half cautious, half
      defiant. In the spring I watch these ravens throughout their
      nest-building, they living for the most part in the trees about my house.
      I've known them to be baffled during a whole two days, when winds were
      blowing and the swaying of the branches prevented their labors.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now and then I have a visit from Morton and the Reverend Bronson. The pair
      are as they were, only more age-worn and of a grayer lock. They were with
      me the other day; Morton as faultless of garb as ever, and with eyeglass
      as much employed, the Reverend Bronson as anxious as in the old time for
      the betterment of humanity. The spirit of unselfishness never flags in
      that good man's breast, although Morton is in constant bicker with him
      concerning the futility of his work.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The fault isn't in you, old chap,&rdquo; said Morton, when last they were with
      me; &ldquo;it isn't, really. But humanity in the mass is such a beastly dullard,
      don't y' know, that to do anything in its favor is casting pearls before
      swine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, then,&rdquo; responded the Reverend Bronson with a smile, &ldquo;if I were you,
      I should help mankind for the good it gave me, without once thinking on
      the object of my generosity.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But,&rdquo; returned Morton, &ldquo;I take no personal joy from helping people. Gad!
      it wearies me. Man is such a perverse beggar; he's ever wrong end to in
      his affairs. The entire race is like a horse turned round in its stall,
      and with its tail in the fodder stands shouting for hay. If men, in what
      you call their troubles, would but face the other way about, nine times in
      ten they'd be all right. They wouldn't need help&mdash;really!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And if what you say be true,&rdquo; observed the Reverend Bronson, who was as
      fond of argument as was Morton, &ldquo;then you have outlined your duty. You say
      folk are turned wrong in their affairs. Then you should help them to turn
      right.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Really now,&rdquo; said Morton, imitating concern, &ldquo;I wouldn't for the world
      have such sentiments escape to the ears of my club, don't y' know, for
      it's beastly bad form to even entertain them, but I lay the trouble you
      seek to relieve, old chap, to that humbug we call civilization; I do, 'pon
      my word!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you cry out against civilization?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gad! why not? I say it is an artifice, a mere deceit. Take ourselves:
      what has it done for any of us? Here is our friend&rdquo;&mdash;Morton dropped
      his hand upon my shoulder&mdash;&ldquo;who, taking advantage of what was offered
      of our civilization, came to be so far victorious as to have the town for
      his kickball. He was a dictator; his word was law among three millions&mdash;really!
      To-day he has riches, and could pave his grounds with gold. He was these
      things, and had these things, from the hand of civilization; and now, at
      the end, he sits in the center of sadness waiting for death. Consider my
      own case: I, too, at the close of my juice-drained days, am waiting for
      death; only, unlike our friend, I play the cynic and while I wait I
      laugh.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was never much to laugh,&rdquo; I interjected.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The more strange, too, don't y' know,&rdquo; continued Morton, &ldquo;since you are
      aware of life and the mockery of it, as much as I. I may take it that I
      came crying into this world, for such I understand to be the beastly
      practice of the human young. Had I understood the empty jest of it, I
      should have laughed; I should, really!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now with what do you charge civilization?&rdquo; asked the Reverend Bronson.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It has made me rich, and I complain of that. The load of my millions
      begins to bend my back. A decent, wholesome savagery would have presented
      no such burdens.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And do you uplift savagery?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't wonder you're shocked, old chap, for from our civilized
      standpoint savagery is such deuced bad form. But you should consider; you
      should, really! Gad! you know that civilized city where we dwell; you know
      its civilized millions, fretting like maggots, as many as four thousand in
      a block; you know the good and the evil ground of those civilized mills!
      Wherein lieth a triumph over the red savage who abode upon the spot three
      centuries ago? Who has liberty as had that savage? He owned laws and
      respected them; he had his tribe, and was a patriot fit to talk with
      William Tell. He fought his foe like a Richard of England, and loved his
      friend like a Jonathan. He paid neither homage to power nor taxes to men,
      and his privileges were as wide as the world's rim. His franchises of
      fagot, vert, and venison had never a limit; he might kill a deer a day and
      burn a cord of wood to its cookery. As for his religion: the test of
      religion is death; and your savage met death with a fortitude, and what is
      fortitude but faith, which it would bother Christians to parallel. It may
      be said that he lived a happier life, saw more of freedom, and was more
      his own man, than any you are to meet in Broadway.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Morton, beneath his fluff of cynicism, was a deal in earnest. The Reverend
      Bronson took advantage of it to say:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here, as you tell us, are we three, and all at the end of the journey.
      Here is that one who strove for power: here is that one who strove for
      wealth; here is that one who strove to help his fellow man. I give you the
      question: Brushing civilization and savagery aside as just no more than
      terms to mark some shadowy difference, I ask you: Who of the three lives
      most content?&mdash;for it is he who was right.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By the way!&rdquo; said Morton, turning to me, as they were about to depart,
      and producing a scrap of newspaper, &ldquo;this is what a scientist writes
      concerning you. The beggar must have paid you a call, don't y' know. At
      first, I thought it a beastly rude thing to put in print; but, gad! the
      more I dwell upon it, the more honorable it becomes. This is what he says
      of you:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'There was a look in his eye such as might burn in the eye of an old wolf
      that has crept away in solitude to die. As I gazed, there swept down upon
      me an astounding conviction. I felt that I was in the presence of the
      oldest thing in the world&mdash;a thing more ancient than the Sphinx or
      aged pyramids. This once Boss, silent and passive and white and old, and
      waiting for the digging of his grave, is what breeders call a &ldquo;throw-back&rdquo;&mdash;a
      throw-back, not of the generations, but of the ages. In what should arm
      him for a war of life against life, he is a creature of utter cunning,
      utter courage, utter strength. He is a troglodyte; he is that original one
      who lived with the cave bear, the mastodon, the sabertoothed tiger, and
      the Irish elk.'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They went away, the Reverend Bronson and Morton, leaving me alone on my
      bench between the beeches, while the black ravens picked and strutted
      about my feet, and my Sicilian on the lake at the lawn's foot matching his
      little ships for another race.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
